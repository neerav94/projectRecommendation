INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand

Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Moreno•http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._MorenoJacob Moreno’s early social network diagram of positive and negative relationships among members of a football team. Originally published in Moreno, J. L. (1934). Who shall survive? Washington, DC: Nervous and Mental Disease Publishing Company.Social Network Analysis 
Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration

two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Moreno•http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._MorenoJacob Moreno’s early social network diagram of positive and negative relationships among members of a football team. Originally published in Moreno, J. L. (1934). Who shall survive? Washington, DC: Nervous and Mental Disease Publishing Company.Social Network Analysis 
Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

Visualizing Big Data: Social Network Analysis 

By Michael Lieberman 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Moreno•http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._MorenoJacob Moreno’s early social network diagram of positive and negative relationships among members of a football team. Originally published in Moreno, J. L. (1934). Who shall survive? Washington, DC: Nervous and Mental Disease Publishing Company.Social Network Analysis 
Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

 Network Map of NodeXLFunctionality•Social Network Map of Software Textbook•Can be applied to Social Network Data•Can analyze organizational structure/literature•Can be applied to Marketing Research VisualsNetwork visualization of transactions tells us an enormous amount about how consumers 
purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

The Twitter Brand Map 
Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis 
announced  some  ‘inconsistencies’  in  her  bio.  As  the  map  shows,  there  is  a  bazaar  of  opinions 
about the viability of the Davis candidacy.

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

 Network Map of NodeXLFunctionality•Social Network Map of Software Textbook•Can be applied to Social Network Data•Can analyze organizational structure/literature•Can be applied to Marketing Research VisualsNetwork visualization of transactions tells us an enormous amount about how consumers 
purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

 Social Network of Supermarket Transactions•The colors of the nodes represent different clusters of products often purchased together•The size of the red connector lines represents the number of transactions•The size of the bubble represent its between group ‘Connectivity’The  managers  at  the  supermarket,  however,  would  like  to  know  which  items  they  need  to 
promote  to  increase  overall  sales.  Best-selling  items  are  not  necessarily  the  correct  answer. 
Hotdogs, for example, are a popular item. But they are connected mainly to catsup and mustard, 
and  not

unknown─information that lettuce and turkey breast are items which spur growth across all food

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its 
clustering  capabilities.  Moreover,  once  the  map  is  set,  it  can  be  run  daily  for  a  month.  The 
reports over that time period reveal the evolving internet conversation. 
 
Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the 
GOP, a news channel, or the Chicago Bulls.

When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

#CASROIn-group / Community 

 

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

#BMWBrand / Public TopicBazaar Networks: Bazaar literally means ‘marketplace’. These networks were named  for their 
diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis 
announced  some  ‘inconsistencies’  in  her  bio.  As  the  map  shows,  there  is  a  bazaar  of  opinions 
about the viability of the Davis candidacy. 

 

A table of the NodeXL output, which clusters hashtags and word pairs, shows differing views of 
Wendy Davis.

@WendyDavisBazaar Network 

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its 
clustering  capabilities.  Moreover,  once  the  map  is  set,  it  can  be  run  daily  for  a  month.  The 
reports over that time period reveal the evolving internet conversation. 
 
Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the 
GOP, a news channel, or the Chicago Bulls. 
 
Forbes publishes a list of the Top 50 Social Influencers. These people many spend a lot of time 
on Social Networks—they are not celebrities—building the industry of Social Business. Among 
the  Top  50  Forbes  Influencers  in  the  Marketing  field  is  Ann  Handley,  the  owner  of

Visualizing Big Data: Social Network Analysis 

By Michael Lieberman 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

#BMWBrand / Public TopicBazaar Networks: Bazaar literally means ‘marketplace’. These networks were named  for their 
diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its

Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the

Visualizing Big Data: Social Network Analysis 

By Michael Lieberman 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Social Networks•History: from the dawn of time!•Theory and method: 1934 ->•Jacob L. Moreno•http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_L._MorenoJacob Moreno’s early social network diagram of positive and negative relationships among members of a football team. Originally published in Moreno, J. L. (1934). Who shall survive? Washington, DC: Nervous and Mental Disease Publishing Company.Social Network Analysis 
Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

 Network Map of NodeXLFunctionality•Social Network Map of Software Textbook•Can be applied to Social Network Data•Can analyze organizational structure/literature•Can be applied to Marketing Research VisualsNetwork visualization of transactions tells us an enormous amount about how consumers 
purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

promote  to  increase  overall  sales.  Best-selling  items  are  not  necessarily  the  correct  answer. 
Hotdogs, for example, are a popular item. But they are connected mainly to catsup and mustard,

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

The Twitter Brand Map 
Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

#CASROIn-group / Community 

 

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

In  addition  to  Twitter,  NodeXL  analyzes  email  networks,  hyperlinks,  FLICKR,  and  Facebook 
friends, ‘Likes’ pages, and groups. Below is an example of a Facebook Social Network Analysis 
map. 
 

 
 
Unlike  Twitter,  Facebook  networks  are  not  publically  available—a  password  is  required  to 
collect data from a user. Therefore, as an example, I used my own Facebook network. I do not 
use Facebook for Multivariate Solutions, so my account reflects life clusters. It is instructive to 
see how NodeXL clusters my Facebook friends. 
 
NodeXL  surveys  all  my  friends,  and  clusters  those  in  my  network  who  are  connected  to  one 
another. It then maps these people around these shared connections. 
 
Examining  my  network,  we  see  three  dominant  clusters.  One  is  my  high  school  class—the

(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to

Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

The Twitter Brand Map 
Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

#CASROIn-group / Community 

 

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

#BMWBrand / Public TopicBazaar Networks: Bazaar literally means ‘marketplace’. These networks were named  for their 
diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis 
announced  some  ‘inconsistencies’  in  her  bio.  As  the  map  shows,  there  is  a  bazaar  of  opinions 
about the viability of the Davis candidacy. 

 

A table of the NodeXL output, which clusters hashtags and word pairs, shows differing views of 
Wendy Davis.

@WendyDavisBazaar Network 

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its 
clustering  capabilities.  Moreover,  once  the  map  is  set,  it  can  be  run  daily  for  a  month.  The 
reports over that time period reveal the evolving internet conversation. 
 
Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the 
GOP, a news channel, or the Chicago Bulls. 
 
Forbes publishes a list of the Top 50 Social Influencers. These people many spend a lot of time 
on Social Networks—they are not celebrities—building the industry of Social Business. Among 
the  Top  50  Forbes  Influencers  in  the  Marketing  field  is  Ann  Handley,  the  owner  of 
@marketingprofs. Below is her Twitter Broadcast map.

month straight, the broadcast map will provide a good sense of the state of client broadcasts. 
 
Twitter Broadcast maps are also a good measure of a celebrity ‘Brand Equity’. A celebrity that 
might  have  once  been  hot  may  have  cooled  off.  One  can  tell  easily  by  scanning  up  to  18,000 
tweets and noting the number of times that celebrity is mentioned. Past celebrities, for example, 
Sarah  Palin  or  Paris  Hilton,  made  the  news  when  they  tweeted.  At  the  time  of  this  writing, 
however, I would wager that their coverage in the mainstream media would be far less extensive 
than, say, two years ago. By identifying the number of people tweeting about a subject out of the 
maximum search, NodeXL can measure the popularity of that subject. 
 
Support Network: Think customer support. These types of networks  are known  to  be good  at 
customer  service.  Organizations  such  as  the  UN  Global  fund  provide  support  for  various 
companies such as Dell Support. Below is an example support network for SAP cloud software. 
These maps are the least common found in social network analysis.

Social Network Analysis with Facebook 
In  addition  to  Twitter,  NodeXL  analyzes  email  networks,  hyperlinks,  FLICKR,  and  Facebook 
friends, ‘Likes’ pages, and groups. Below is an example of a Facebook Social Network Analysis 
map. 
 

 
 
Unlike  Twitter,  Facebook  networks  are  not  publically  available—a  password  is  required  to 
collect data from a user. Therefore, as an example, I used my own Facebook network. I do not 
use Facebook for Multivariate Solutions, so my account reflects life clusters. It is instructive to 
see how NodeXL clusters my Facebook friends. 
 
NodeXL  surveys  all  my  friends,  and  clusters  those  in  my  network  who  are  connected  to  one 
another. It then maps these people around these shared connections. 
 
Examining  my  network,  we  see  three  dominant  clusters.  One  is  my  high  school  class—the  
reason I originally got on Facebook. The second is my current social circle. The third is family. I

Mining Facebook ‘Likes’ Pages. 
Our Social Network Analysis software has the ability to mine Facebook ‘Likes’ pages without a 
password. For major brands, such as Starbucks, thousands of likes and comments are recorded 
each day. 
 

 

In just two days, more than 360,000 likes and comments were registered on the main Starbucks 
‘Likes’ pages. By examining the above graph, we see that nearly 12,000 people visited the site. 
 
This amount of data is best synthesized by platforms that perform Sentiment Analysis; NodeXL 
would lose the nuance of the comments. 
 
Social  Network  Analysis  visualizations  using  NodeXL  would  work  wonders,  however,  with 
local  business  Facebook  pages.  Identification  and  targeting  of  local  influencers,  for  instance,  a 
local  microbrewery,  restaurant,  or  boutique  florist  could  be  performed  very  effectively.  Such  a 
client would simply surrender his or her Facebook password to be analyzed. The amount of data 
would not overwhelm NodeXL, and local influencers could be easily identified.

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an

they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

The Twitter Brand Map 
Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

#CASROIn-group / Community 

 

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

#BMWBrand / Public TopicBazaar Networks: Bazaar literally means ‘marketplace’. These networks were named  for their 
diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis 
announced  some  ‘inconsistencies’  in  her  bio.  As  the  map  shows,  there  is  a  bazaar  of  opinions 
about the viability of the Davis candidacy. 

 

A table of the NodeXL output, which clusters hashtags and word pairs, shows differing views of 
Wendy Davis.

@WendyDavisBazaar Network 

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its 
clustering  capabilities.  Moreover,  once  the  map  is  set,  it  can  be  run  daily  for  a  month.  The 
reports over that time period reveal the evolving internet conversation. 
 
Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the 
GOP, a news channel, or the Chicago Bulls. 
 
Forbes publishes a list of the Top 50 Social Influencers. These people many spend a lot of time 
on Social Networks—they are not celebrities—building the industry of Social Business. Among 
the  Top  50  Forbes  Influencers  in  the  Marketing  field  is  Ann  Handley,  the  owner  of 
@marketingprofs. Below is her Twitter Broadcast map.

month straight, the broadcast map will provide a good sense of the state of client broadcasts. 
 
Twitter Broadcast maps are also a good measure of a celebrity ‘Brand Equity’. A celebrity that 
might  have  once  been  hot  may  have  cooled  off.  One  can  tell  easily  by  scanning  up  to  18,000 
tweets and noting the number of times that celebrity is mentioned. Past celebrities, for example, 
Sarah  Palin  or  Paris  Hilton,  made  the  news  when  they  tweeted.  At  the  time  of  this  writing, 
however, I would wager that their coverage in the mainstream media would be far less extensive 
than, say, two years ago. By identifying the number of people tweeting about a subject out of the 
maximum search, NodeXL can measure the popularity of that subject. 
 
Support Network: Think customer support. These types of networks  are known  to  be good  at 
customer  service.  Organizations  such  as  the  UN  Global  fund  provide  support  for  various 
companies such as Dell Support. Below is an example support network for SAP cloud software. 
These maps are the least common found in social network analysis.

Social Network Analysis with Facebook 
In  addition  to  Twitter,  NodeXL  analyzes  email  networks,  hyperlinks,  FLICKR,  and  Facebook 
friends, ‘Likes’ pages, and groups. Below is an example of a Facebook Social Network Analysis 
map. 
 

 
 
Unlike  Twitter,  Facebook  networks  are  not  publically  available—a  password  is  required  to 
collect data from a user. Therefore, as an example, I used my own Facebook network. I do not 
use Facebook for Multivariate Solutions, so my account reflects life clusters. It is instructive to 
see how NodeXL clusters my Facebook friends. 
 
NodeXL  surveys  all  my  friends,  and  clusters  those  in  my  network  who  are  connected  to  one 
another. It then maps these people around these shared connections. 
 
Examining  my  network,  we  see  three  dominant  clusters.  One  is  my  high  school  class—the  
reason I originally got on Facebook. The second is my current social circle. The third is family. I

people who I worked with at Ristorante Alfredo in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1986 while I

Mining Facebook ‘Likes’ Pages. 
Our Social Network Analysis software has the ability to mine Facebook ‘Likes’ pages without a 
password. For major brands, such as Starbucks, thousands of likes and comments are recorded 
each day. 
 

 

In just two days, more than 360,000 likes and comments were registered on the main Starbucks 
‘Likes’ pages. By examining the above graph, we see that nearly 12,000 people visited the site. 
 
This amount of data is best synthesized by platforms that perform Sentiment Analysis; NodeXL 
would lose the nuance of the comments. 
 
Social  Network  Analysis  visualizations  using  NodeXL  would  work  wonders,  however,  with 
local  business  Facebook  pages.  Identification  and  targeting  of  local  influencers,  for  instance,  a 
local  microbrewery,  restaurant,  or  boutique  florist  could  be  performed  very  effectively.  Such  a 
client would simply surrender his or her Facebook password to be analyzed. The amount of data 
would not overwhelm NodeXL, and local influencers could be easily identified.

The World Wide Web functions as the world's largest network graph wherein web pages link to 
one another. The tens of billions of pages on the World Wide Web can each be seen as a vertex 
in a graph whose edges are URL hyperlinks connecting one page to another. There is no larger 
source of interlinked information. 
 
Professor  Robert  Ackland  of  the  Australian  National  University  highlights  the  promise  of  the 
web,  “These  hyperlinks  may  point  to  other  pages  on  the  same  web  site  or  to  sites  of  other 
organizations,  companies,  institutions,  and  nations.  The  result  is  literally  a  web  of  connections 
that is often mentioned but rarely seen. The network of related web sites, although based on basic 
“Web  1.0”  technologies,  represents  important  social,  economic,  and  institutional  relationships 
that can reveal significant insights for researchers, policy makers, and corporate strategists.” 
 
Web  pages  are  the  untapped  gold  mine  of  Big  Data  information.  An  entire  industry,  Search 
Engine Marketing, has grown up around the late 1990s internet explosion. But who your website 
is  connected  to,  and  who  connects  to  your  website,  is  really  the  mother  lode  of  network  take-
aways.  With  new  technology,  these  links  have  now  come  online  using  free,  open-source 
software. 
 
Collecting and analyzing hyperlink network data allows you to answer questions like: How does 
your organizational web presence compare with  your “offline” brand presence? How does your 
organizational web presence compare with that of your competitors? Where is the cross-branding 
taking place? 
 
Hyperlink  data  can  also  help  you  identify  new  competitors.  If  you  are  entering  a  new  market, 
these  data  can  give  you  a  sense  of  the  current  players  and  their  inter-relationships.  If  your 
organization is public affairs, what other organizations are linked to it? If you run a non-profit, 
who links to you? In other words, what is your best fundraising source? 
 
The VOSON Data Provider 
The VOSON Data Provider is  a NodeXL data import plug-in for the collection and analysis of 
hyperlink network data. It provides a front-end to a data collection and processing service that is 
part of the Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks (VOSON). This data collection 
and processing service consists of a web crawler that crawls “seed sites” nominated by the user, 
extracting  hyperlinks  to  other  sites.  The  service  also  finds  inbound  hyperlinks  to  a  given  seed 
sites. 
 
One would need to set up an account with VOSON, but a free version is available for up to ten 
databases. Of course, web crawling is nothing new. Spammers have been doing it since the dawn 
of the web. The beauty of VOSON is that it is a specialized hyperlink search service that works

Visualizing Big Data: Social Network Analysis 

By Michael Lieberman 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

 Network Map of NodeXLFunctionality•Social Network Map of Software Textbook•Can be applied to Social Network Data•Can analyze organizational structure/literature•Can be applied to Marketing Research VisualsNetwork visualization of transactions tells us an enormous amount about how consumers 
purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

The Twitter Brand Map 
Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

#CASROIn-group / Community 

 

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

#BMWBrand / Public TopicBazaar Networks: Bazaar literally means ‘marketplace’. These networks were named  for their 
diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis 
announced  some  ‘inconsistencies’  in  her  bio.  As  the  map  shows,  there  is  a  bazaar  of  opinions 
about the viability of the Davis candidacy. 

 

A table of the NodeXL output, which clusters hashtags and word pairs, shows differing views of 
Wendy Davis.

@WendyDavisBazaar Network 

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its 
clustering  capabilities.  Moreover,  once  the  map  is  set,  it  can  be  run  daily  for  a  month.  The 
reports over that time period reveal the evolving internet conversation. 
 
Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the 
GOP, a news channel, or the Chicago Bulls. 
 
Forbes publishes a list of the Top 50 Social Influencers. These people many spend a lot of time 
on Social Networks—they are not celebrities—building the industry of Social Business. Among 
the  Top  50  Forbes  Influencers  in  the  Marketing  field  is  Ann  Handley,  the  owner  of 
@marketingprofs. Below is her Twitter Broadcast map.

month straight, the broadcast map will provide a good sense of the state of client broadcasts. 
 
Twitter Broadcast maps are also a good measure of a celebrity ‘Brand Equity’. A celebrity that 
might  have  once  been  hot  may  have  cooled  off.  One  can  tell  easily  by  scanning  up  to  18,000 
tweets and noting the number of times that celebrity is mentioned. Past celebrities, for example, 
Sarah  Palin  or  Paris  Hilton,  made  the  news  when  they  tweeted.  At  the  time  of  this  writing, 
however, I would wager that their coverage in the mainstream media would be far less extensive 
than, say, two years ago. By identifying the number of people tweeting about a subject out of the 
maximum search, NodeXL can measure the popularity of that subject. 
 
Support Network: Think customer support. These types of networks  are known  to  be good  at 
customer  service.  Organizations  such  as  the  UN  Global  fund  provide  support  for  various 
companies such as Dell Support. Below is an example support network for SAP cloud software. 
These maps are the least common found in social network analysis.

Social Network Analysis with Facebook 
In  addition  to  Twitter,  NodeXL  analyzes  email  networks,  hyperlinks,  FLICKR,  and  Facebook 
friends, ‘Likes’ pages, and groups. Below is an example of a Facebook Social Network Analysis 
map. 
 

 
 
Unlike  Twitter,  Facebook  networks  are  not  publically  available—a  password  is  required  to 
collect data from a user. Therefore, as an example, I used my own Facebook network. I do not 
use Facebook for Multivariate Solutions, so my account reflects life clusters. It is instructive to 
see how NodeXL clusters my Facebook friends. 
 
NodeXL  surveys  all  my  friends,  and  clusters  those  in  my  network  who  are  connected  to  one 
another. It then maps these people around these shared connections. 
 
Examining  my  network,  we  see  three  dominant  clusters.  One  is  my  high  school  class—the  
reason I originally got on Facebook. The second is my current social circle. The third is family. I

Mining Facebook ‘Likes’ Pages. 
Our Social Network Analysis software has the ability to mine Facebook ‘Likes’ pages without a 
password. For major brands, such as Starbucks, thousands of likes and comments are recorded 
each day. 
 

 

In just two days, more than 360,000 likes and comments were registered on the main Starbucks 
‘Likes’ pages. By examining the above graph, we see that nearly 12,000 people visited the site. 
 
This amount of data is best synthesized by platforms that perform Sentiment Analysis; NodeXL 
would lose the nuance of the comments. 
 
Social  Network  Analysis  visualizations  using  NodeXL  would  work  wonders,  however,  with 
local  business  Facebook  pages.  Identification  and  targeting  of  local  influencers,  for  instance,  a 
local  microbrewery,  restaurant,  or  boutique  florist  could  be  performed  very  effectively.  Such  a 
client would simply surrender his or her Facebook password to be analyzed. The amount of data 
would not overwhelm NodeXL, and local influencers could be easily identified.

The World Wide Web functions as the world's largest network graph wherein web pages link to 
one another. The tens of billions of pages on the World Wide Web can each be seen as a vertex 
in a graph whose edges are URL hyperlinks connecting one page to another. There is no larger 
source of interlinked information. 
 
Professor  Robert  Ackland  of  the  Australian  National  University  highlights  the  promise  of  the 
web,  “These  hyperlinks  may  point  to  other  pages  on  the  same  web  site  or  to  sites  of  other 
organizations,  companies,  institutions,  and  nations.  The  result  is  literally  a  web  of  connections 
that is often mentioned but rarely seen. The network of related web sites, although based on basic 
“Web  1.0”  technologies,  represents  important  social,  economic,  and  institutional  relationships 
that can reveal significant insights for researchers, policy makers, and corporate strategists.” 
 
Web  pages  are  the  untapped  gold  mine  of  Big  Data  information.  An  entire  industry,  Search 
Engine Marketing, has grown up around the late 1990s internet explosion. But who your website 
is  connected  to,  and  who  connects  to  your  website,  is  really  the  mother  lode  of  network  take-
aways.  With  new  technology,  these  links  have  now  come  online  using  free,  open-source 
software. 
 
Collecting and analyzing hyperlink network data allows you to answer questions like: How does 
your organizational web presence compare with  your “offline” brand presence? How does your 
organizational web presence compare with that of your competitors? Where is the cross-branding 
taking place? 
 
Hyperlink  data  can  also  help  you  identify  new  competitors.  If  you  are  entering  a  new  market, 
these  data  can  give  you  a  sense  of  the  current  players  and  their  inter-relationships.  If  your 
organization is public affairs, what other organizations are linked to it? If you run a non-profit, 
who links to you? In other words, what is your best fundraising source? 
 
The VOSON Data Provider 
The VOSON Data Provider is  a NodeXL data import plug-in for the collection and analysis of 
hyperlink network data. It provides a front-end to a data collection and processing service that is 
part of the Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks (VOSON). This data collection 
and processing service consists of a web crawler that crawls “seed sites” nominated by the user, 
extracting  hyperlinks  to  other  sites.  The  service  also  finds  inbound  hyperlinks  to  a  given  seed 
sites. 
 
One would need to set up an account with VOSON, but a free version is available for up to ten 
databases. Of course, web crawling is nothing new. Spammers have been doing it since the dawn 
of the web. The beauty of VOSON is that it is a specialized hyperlink search service that works

within  the  framework  of  NodeXL.  The  results,  which  are  delivered  in  a  format  much  like,  for 
example,  Twitter  links,  makes  it  easy  for  non-programmers  with  a  bit  of  Excel  savvy  to  edit, 
shape, and ultimately visualize and analyze the data.

VOSON crawls the web looking for both inbound and outbound links to the seed websites. It is 
possible to control the number of links one sees. While there are space limitations, once the sites 
are crawled, the data can be downloaded into Excel in a format that NodeXL can analyze without 
a great deal of data preparation.

Visualizing Big Data: Social Network Analysis

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

 Network Map of NodeXLFunctionality•Social Network Map of Software Textbook•Can be applied to Social Network Data•Can analyze organizational structure/literature•Can be applied to Marketing Research VisualsNetwork visualization of transactions tells us an enormous amount about how consumers 
purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

promote  to  increase  overall  sales.  Best-selling  items  are  not  necessarily  the  correct  answer. 
Hotdogs, for example, are a popular item. But they are connected mainly to catsup and mustard,

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set

There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

The Twitter Brand Map 
Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

#CASROIn-group / Community 

 

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

#BMWBrand / Public TopicBazaar Networks: Bazaar literally means ‘marketplace’. These networks were named  for their 
diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis 
announced  some  ‘inconsistencies’  in  her  bio.  As  the  map  shows,  there  is  a  bazaar  of  opinions 
about the viability of the Davis candidacy. 

 

A table of the NodeXL output, which clusters hashtags and word pairs, shows differing views of 
Wendy Davis.

@WendyDavisBazaar Network 

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its 
clustering  capabilities.  Moreover,  once  the  map  is  set,  it  can  be  run  daily  for  a  month.  The 
reports over that time period reveal the evolving internet conversation. 
 
Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the 
GOP, a news channel, or the Chicago Bulls. 
 
Forbes publishes a list of the Top 50 Social Influencers. These people many spend a lot of time 
on Social Networks—they are not celebrities—building the industry of Social Business. Among 
the  Top  50  Forbes  Influencers  in  the  Marketing  field  is  Ann  Handley,  the  owner  of 
@marketingprofs. Below is her Twitter Broadcast map.

month straight, the broadcast map will provide a good sense of the state of client broadcasts. 
 
Twitter Broadcast maps are also a good measure of a celebrity ‘Brand Equity’. A celebrity that 
might  have  once  been  hot  may  have  cooled  off.  One  can  tell  easily  by  scanning  up  to  18,000 
tweets and noting the number of times that celebrity is mentioned. Past celebrities, for example, 
Sarah  Palin  or  Paris  Hilton,  made  the  news  when  they  tweeted.  At  the  time  of  this  writing, 
however, I would wager that their coverage in the mainstream media would be far less extensive 
than, say, two years ago. By identifying the number of people tweeting about a subject out of the 
maximum search, NodeXL can measure the popularity of that subject. 
 
Support Network: Think customer support. These types of networks  are known  to  be good  at 
customer  service.  Organizations  such  as  the  UN  Global  fund  provide  support  for  various 
companies such as Dell Support. Below is an example support network for SAP cloud software. 
These maps are the least common found in social network analysis.

Social Network Analysis with Facebook 
In  addition  to  Twitter,  NodeXL  analyzes  email  networks,  hyperlinks,  FLICKR,  and  Facebook 
friends, ‘Likes’ pages, and groups. Below is an example of a Facebook Social Network Analysis 
map. 
 

 
 
Unlike  Twitter,  Facebook  networks  are  not  publically  available—a  password  is  required  to 
collect data from a user. Therefore, as an example, I used my own Facebook network. I do not 
use Facebook for Multivariate Solutions, so my account reflects life clusters. It is instructive to 
see how NodeXL clusters my Facebook friends. 
 
NodeXL  surveys  all  my  friends,  and  clusters  those  in  my  network  who  are  connected  to  one 
another. It then maps these people around these shared connections. 
 
Examining  my  network,  we  see  three  dominant  clusters.  One  is  my  high  school  class—the  
reason I originally got on Facebook. The second is my current social circle. The third is family. I

blue  circle  around  a  tiny  cluster  at  the  bottom,  right-most  corner  of  the  map.  These  are  a  few 
people who I worked with at Ristorante Alfredo in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1986 while I 
was an undergraduate at Rutgers University. 
 
Mining Facebook ‘Likes’ Pages. 
Our Social Network Analysis software has the ability to mine Facebook ‘Likes’ pages without a 
password. For major brands, such as Starbucks, thousands of likes and comments are recorded 
each day. 
 

 

In just two days, more than 360,000 likes and comments were registered on the main Starbucks 
‘Likes’ pages. By examining the above graph, we see that nearly 12,000 people visited the site. 
 
This amount of data is best synthesized by platforms that perform Sentiment Analysis; NodeXL 
would lose the nuance of the comments. 
 
Social  Network  Analysis  visualizations  using  NodeXL  would  work  wonders,  however,  with 
local  business  Facebook  pages.  Identification  and  targeting  of  local  influencers,  for  instance,  a 
local  microbrewery,  restaurant,  or  boutique  florist  could  be  performed  very  effectively.  Such  a 
client would simply surrender his or her Facebook password to be analyzed. The amount of data 
would not overwhelm NodeXL, and local influencers could be easily identified.

The World Wide Web functions as the world's largest network graph wherein web pages link to 
one another. The tens of billions of pages on the World Wide Web can each be seen as a vertex 
in a graph whose edges are URL hyperlinks connecting one page to another. There is no larger 
source of interlinked information. 
 
Professor  Robert  Ackland  of  the  Australian  National  University  highlights  the  promise  of  the 
web,  “These  hyperlinks  may  point  to  other  pages  on  the  same  web  site  or  to  sites  of  other 
organizations,  companies,  institutions,  and  nations.  The  result  is  literally  a  web  of  connections 
that is often mentioned but rarely seen. The network of related web sites, although based on basic 
“Web  1.0”  technologies,  represents  important  social,  economic,  and  institutional  relationships 
that can reveal significant insights for researchers, policy makers, and corporate strategists.” 
 
Web  pages  are  the  untapped  gold  mine  of  Big  Data  information.  An  entire  industry,  Search 
Engine Marketing, has grown up around the late 1990s internet explosion. But who your website 
is  connected  to,  and  who  connects  to  your  website,  is  really  the  mother  lode  of  network  take-
aways.  With  new  technology,  these  links  have  now  come  online  using  free,  open-source 
software. 
 
Collecting and analyzing hyperlink network data allows you to answer questions like: How does 
your organizational web presence compare with  your “offline” brand presence? How does your 
organizational web presence compare with that of your competitors? Where is the cross-branding 
taking place? 
 
Hyperlink  data  can  also  help  you  identify  new  competitors.  If  you  are  entering  a  new  market, 
these  data  can  give  you  a  sense  of  the  current  players  and  their  inter-relationships.  If  your 
organization is public affairs, what other organizations are linked to it? If you run a non-profit, 
who links to you? In other words, what is your best fundraising source? 
 
The VOSON Data Provider 
The VOSON Data Provider is  a NodeXL data import plug-in for the collection and analysis of 
hyperlink network data. It provides a front-end to a data collection and processing service that is 
part of the Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks (VOSON). This data collection 
and processing service consists of a web crawler that crawls “seed sites” nominated by the user, 
extracting  hyperlinks  to  other  sites.  The  service  also  finds  inbound  hyperlinks  to  a  given  seed 
sites. 
 
One would need to set up an account with VOSON, but a free version is available for up to ten 
databases. Of course, web crawling is nothing new. Spammers have been doing it since the dawn 
of the web. The beauty of VOSON is that it is a specialized hyperlink search service that works

within  the  framework  of  NodeXL.  The  results,  which  are  delivered  in  a  format  much  like,  for 
example,  Twitter  links,  makes  it  easy  for  non-programmers  with  a  bit  of  Excel  savvy  to  edit, 
shape, and ultimately visualize and analyze the data.

VOSON crawls the web looking for both inbound and outbound links to the seed websites. It is 
possible to control the number of links one sees. While there are space limitations, once the sites 
are crawled, the data can be downloaded into Excel in a format that NodeXL can analyze without 
a great deal of data preparation.

VOSON)  were  labeled.  The  results  give  us  a  picture  of  the  ‘industry  space’  of  the  limited 
marketing research websites I asked to crawl. 
 
Next,  I  decided  to  try  a  hyperlink  network  for  an  industry  that  I  do  a  lot  of  work  for,  casual 
dining restaurants. The seed sites were several of the most popular restaurants, such as the Olive 
Garden, the Cheesecake Factory, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Applebee’s, among a few others. 
 

I have circled some of the seed sites, and labeled some of the more interesting links. What our 
graph shows us are lists for employment on Craig’s List, local media reviews of restaurants, food 
blogs, college campuses where specials might have been made for a particular restaurant, and a 
link between the NHL Detroit Redwings, who co-branded with Applebee’s under the banner of 
“Applebee's, Your Home for Hockey - Detroit Red Wings - Fan Zone”. 
 
The main advantage of hyperlink network analysis is that it is not as fluid as, say, Twitter. One 
can run a web crawl for an industry space and be fairly sure that the structure will be intact for a

Visualizing Big Data: Social Network Analysis

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

 Network Map of NodeXLFunctionality•Social Network Map of Software Textbook•Can be applied to Social Network Data•Can analyze organizational structure/literature•Can be applied to Marketing Research VisualsNetwork visualization of transactions tells us an enormous amount about how consumers 
purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

promote  to  increase  overall  sales.  Best-selling  items  are  not  necessarily  the  correct  answer. 
Hotdogs, for example, are a popular item. But they are connected mainly to catsup and mustard,

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of

There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

The Twitter Brand Map 
Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

#CASROIn-group / Community 

 

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

#BMWBrand / Public TopicBazaar Networks: Bazaar literally means ‘marketplace’. These networks were named  for their 
diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis 
announced  some  ‘inconsistencies’  in  her  bio.  As  the  map  shows,  there  is  a  bazaar  of  opinions 
about the viability of the Davis candidacy. 

 

A table of the NodeXL output, which clusters hashtags and word pairs, shows differing views of 
Wendy Davis.

@WendyDavisBazaar Network 

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its 
clustering  capabilities.  Moreover,  once  the  map  is  set,  it  can  be  run  daily  for  a  month.  The 
reports over that time period reveal the evolving internet conversation. 
 
Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the 
GOP, a news channel, or the Chicago Bulls. 
 
Forbes publishes a list of the Top 50 Social Influencers. These people many spend a lot of time 
on Social Networks—they are not celebrities—building the industry of Social Business. Among 
the  Top  50  Forbes  Influencers  in  the  Marketing  field  is  Ann  Handley,  the  owner  of 
@marketingprofs. Below is her Twitter Broadcast map.

month straight, the broadcast map will provide a good sense of the state of client broadcasts. 
 
Twitter Broadcast maps are also a good measure of a celebrity ‘Brand Equity’. A celebrity that 
might  have  once  been  hot  may  have  cooled  off.  One  can  tell  easily  by  scanning  up  to  18,000 
tweets and noting the number of times that celebrity is mentioned. Past celebrities, for example, 
Sarah  Palin  or  Paris  Hilton,  made  the  news  when  they  tweeted.  At  the  time  of  this  writing, 
however, I would wager that their coverage in the mainstream media would be far less extensive 
than, say, two years ago. By identifying the number of people tweeting about a subject out of the 
maximum search, NodeXL can measure the popularity of that subject. 
 
Support Network: Think customer support. These types of networks  are known  to  be good  at 
customer  service.  Organizations  such  as  the  UN  Global  fund  provide  support  for  various 
companies such as Dell Support. Below is an example support network for SAP cloud software. 
These maps are the least common found in social network analysis.

Social Network Analysis with Facebook 
In  addition  to  Twitter,  NodeXL  analyzes  email  networks,  hyperlinks,  FLICKR,  and  Facebook 
friends, ‘Likes’ pages, and groups. Below is an example of a Facebook Social Network Analysis 
map. 
 

 
 
Unlike  Twitter,  Facebook  networks  are  not  publically  available—a  password  is  required  to 
collect data from a user. Therefore, as an example, I used my own Facebook network. I do not 
use Facebook for Multivariate Solutions, so my account reflects life clusters. It is instructive to 
see how NodeXL clusters my Facebook friends. 
 
NodeXL  surveys  all  my  friends,  and  clusters  those  in  my  network  who  are  connected  to  one 
another. It then maps these people around these shared connections. 
 
Examining  my  network,  we  see  three  dominant  clusters.  One  is  my  high  school  class—the  
reason I originally got on Facebook. The second is my current social circle. The third is family. I

blue  circle  around  a  tiny  cluster  at  the  bottom,  right-most  corner  of  the  map.  These  are  a  few 
people who I worked with at Ristorante Alfredo in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1986 while I 
was an undergraduate at Rutgers University. 
 
Mining Facebook ‘Likes’ Pages. 
Our Social Network Analysis software has the ability to mine Facebook ‘Likes’ pages without a 
password. For major brands, such as Starbucks, thousands of likes and comments are recorded 
each day. 
 

 

In just two days, more than 360,000 likes and comments were registered on the main Starbucks 
‘Likes’ pages. By examining the above graph, we see that nearly 12,000 people visited the site. 
 
This amount of data is best synthesized by platforms that perform Sentiment Analysis; NodeXL 
would lose the nuance of the comments. 
 
Social  Network  Analysis  visualizations  using  NodeXL  would  work  wonders,  however,  with 
local  business  Facebook  pages.  Identification  and  targeting  of  local  influencers,  for  instance,  a 
local  microbrewery,  restaurant,  or  boutique  florist  could  be  performed  very  effectively.  Such  a 
client would simply surrender his or her Facebook password to be analyzed. The amount of data 
would not overwhelm NodeXL, and local influencers could be easily identified.

The World Wide Web functions as the world's largest network graph wherein web pages link to 
one another. The tens of billions of pages on the World Wide Web can each be seen as a vertex 
in a graph whose edges are URL hyperlinks connecting one page to another. There is no larger 
source of interlinked information. 
 
Professor  Robert  Ackland  of  the  Australian  National  University  highlights  the  promise  of  the 
web,  “These  hyperlinks  may  point  to  other  pages  on  the  same  web  site  or  to  sites  of  other 
organizations,  companies,  institutions,  and  nations.  The  result  is  literally  a  web  of  connections 
that is often mentioned but rarely seen. The network of related web sites, although based on basic 
“Web  1.0”  technologies,  represents  important  social,  economic,  and  institutional  relationships 
that can reveal significant insights for researchers, policy makers, and corporate strategists.” 
 
Web  pages  are  the  untapped  gold  mine  of  Big  Data  information.  An  entire  industry,  Search 
Engine Marketing, has grown up around the late 1990s internet explosion. But who your website 
is  connected  to,  and  who  connects  to  your  website,  is  really  the  mother  lode  of  network  take-
aways.  With  new  technology,  these  links  have  now  come  online  using  free,  open-source 
software. 
 
Collecting and analyzing hyperlink network data allows you to answer questions like: How does 
your organizational web presence compare with  your “offline” brand presence? How does your 
organizational web presence compare with that of your competitors? Where is the cross-branding 
taking place? 
 
Hyperlink  data  can  also  help  you  identify  new  competitors.  If  you  are  entering  a  new  market, 
these  data  can  give  you  a  sense  of  the  current  players  and  their  inter-relationships.  If  your 
organization is public affairs, what other organizations are linked to it? If you run a non-profit, 
who links to you? In other words, what is your best fundraising source? 
 
The VOSON Data Provider 
The VOSON Data Provider is  a NodeXL data import plug-in for the collection and analysis of 
hyperlink network data. It provides a front-end to a data collection and processing service that is 
part of the Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks (VOSON). This data collection 
and processing service consists of a web crawler that crawls “seed sites” nominated by the user, 
extracting  hyperlinks  to  other  sites.  The  service  also  finds  inbound  hyperlinks  to  a  given  seed 
sites. 
 
One would need to set up an account with VOSON, but a free version is available for up to ten 
databases. Of course, web crawling is nothing new. Spammers have been doing it since the dawn 
of the web. The beauty of VOSON is that it is a specialized hyperlink search service that works

within  the  framework  of  NodeXL.  The  results,  which  are  delivered  in  a  format  much  like,  for 
example,  Twitter  links,  makes  it  easy  for  non-programmers  with  a  bit  of  Excel  savvy  to  edit, 
shape, and ultimately visualize and analyze the data.

VOSON crawls the web looking for both inbound and outbound links to the seed websites. It is 
possible to control the number of links one sees. While there are space limitations, once the sites 
are crawled, the data can be downloaded into Excel in a format that NodeXL can analyze without 
a great deal of data preparation.

Hyperlink SpaceMarketing Research IndustryThe graph above was filtered, and then various links (among the 4000 or so which emerged from 
VOSON)  were  labeled.  The  results  give  us  a  picture  of  the  ‘industry  space’  of  the  limited 
marketing research websites I asked to crawl. 
 
Next,  I  decided  to  try  a  hyperlink  network  for  an  industry  that  I  do  a  lot  of  work  for,  casual 
dining restaurants. The seed sites were several of the most popular restaurants, such as the Olive 
Garden, the Cheesecake Factory, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Applebee’s, among a few others. 
 

I have circled some of the seed sites, and labeled some of the more interesting links. What our 
graph shows us are lists for employment on Craig’s List, local media reviews of restaurants, food 
blogs, college campuses where specials might have been made for a particular restaurant, and a 
link between the NHL Detroit Redwings, who co-branded with Applebee’s under the banner of 
“Applebee's, Your Home for Hockey - Detroit Red Wings - Fan Zone”. 
 
The main advantage of hyperlink network analysis is that it is not as fluid as, say, Twitter. One 
can run a web crawl for an industry space and be fairly sure that the structure will be intact for a

media, and “Web 2.0” applications. 
 
Research Challenges for Social Network Analysis 
Personal  Twitter  networks  can  only  be  mined  to  a  limited  extent.  Currently,  the  Twitter  API 
(application  programming  interface)  imposes  severe  limits  on  this  activity.  Let's  say,  for 
instance, that  you  are  interested  in who is  following a particular  account  rather than in  what  is 
being  tweeted.  Twitter  imposes  strict  limits  on  how  many  links  you  may  download  in  a  15-
minute time span. In practice, that would mean that downloading a meaningful Twitter account 
network would take  days—and often the API will cut  off  your access  in  the middle. Efforts  to 
streamline the Twitter API are underway. However, at this time, the limits are still in place. 
 
Additionally  a  low-tech  challenge,  attention  span,  must  also  be  considered.  Corporate  brand 
managers and C-suite executives have been slow to embrace this new technology. They glance at 
a Twitter map and say "That’s nice, what does it mean?" The explanation, though, can take a few 
minutes. 
 
Researchers  are  racing  to  design  easily  deployable  deliverables.  When  we  can  explain  in  one 
sentence  the  meaning  of  a  ‘brand  conversation’  or  an  ‘internet  industry  space,’  then  large 
corporations will adopt the new techniques and add them to their existing arsenal of marketing 
research applications. 
 
Conclusion 
We  are  living  in  an  increasingly  saturated  world.  Facebook,  Twitter,  Google,  smartphones—
there is so much marketing noise that even big TV networks and news giants no longer have the 
ability to guarantee overnight product success. 
 
The result is a growing effort by smart organizations to augment their campaigns through proven 
media  channels  with  social  network  analysis.  That  is,  these  companies  have  learned  to  harness 
the power of thought leaders, experts, and influencers to promote their products. Social network 
analysis plays a starring role in the forthcoming drama.

Visualizing Big Data: Social Network Analysis 

By Michael Lieberman 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 
We live in an interconnected world. What began as a dream of academic researchers has entered 
the realm of commerce and politics. What began as an experiment run by computer scientists in 
the IBM labs has morphed into human-computer interactions and social network analysis, and is 
driven by social media and information visualization. 
 
Social researchers became entrepreneurs, and the phenomenal success of social media platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia perceived their output as networks. 
That  is,  interconnected  actors  related  to  each  other.  Sociologists  introduced  the  language  of 
social  communities,  and  in  academic  research  laboratories  researchers  studied  motivation, 
influence, and social roles on the internet. 
 
Many  research  groups  and  startup  companies  have  developed  tools  for  social  media  network 
analysis and visualization. Today, network metrics has become commonplace and functionality 
on  layout  and  clustering  algorithms  has  expanded  dramatically,  producing  breakthroughs  that 
have raised the quality of what it is possible to visualize. 
 
Historical Perspective 
According  to  Wikipedia,  social  network  analysis  is  “the  analysis  of  social  networks.  Social 
network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of  nodes 
(representing individual actors within the network) and ties. These networks are often depicted in 
a  social  network  diagram,  where  nodes  are  represented  as  points  and  ties  are  represented  as 
lines.” 
 
Social network analysis has its theoretical roots in the work of early sociologists such as Georg 
Simmel  and  Émile  Durkheim,  who  wrote  about  the  importance  of  studying  patterns  of 
relationships  that  connect  social  actors.  Social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of  "social 
networks"  since  early  in  the  20th  century  to  denote  complex  sets  of  relationships  between 
members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. 
 
In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term to describe patterns of ties, encompassing both lay 
and scientific concepts: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, 
ethnicity). Scholars such as Jacob Moreno have employed the term social network to describe all 
sorts of social interaction. This usage has expanded in the last 30 years by the use of systematic 
social  network  analysis.  Social  network  analysis  has  found  applications  in  various  academic 
disciplines, as well as important practical applications such as countering money laundering and 
terrorism. Even corporate organizational structures and classic literature have been analyzed with 
these tools.

Introduction of Open Source Big Data Synthesize - NodeXL 
Marc Smith is a sociologist who specializes in the social organization of online communities and 
computer-mediated interaction; he and I met at a recent Predictive Analytics conference. Smith 
leads  the  Connected  Action  consulting  group  in  Silicon  Valley,  California  and  co-founded  the 
Social  Media  Research  Foundation.  Marc  has  pioneered  a  revolutionary  graphics  program, 
NodeXL, which synthesizes and clusters social network data. 
 
Instead of a complicated listening platform, NodeXL is able to synthesize, for example, Twitter 
feeds, and produce a relevant graphic and report. NodeXL creates maps that make sense of social 
media, and that is just the beginning. 
 
Thanks to Marc’s mentoring, I have functionally mastered NodeXL and learned how to make its 
output relevant to the marketing-research industry. 
 
This  paper  will  present  the  fundamentals  of  social  network  analysis.  I  will  provide  sample 
Twitter  and  Facebook  maps  and  show  how  they  may  be  used  for  understanding  brand 
conversations on the socialmediaosphere. In addition, we will explore marketing applications for 
hyperlink networks, where a massive potential lies for this technology.

Originally published in Moreno, J. L. (1934). Who shall survive? Washington, DC: Nervous and Mental Disease Publishing Company.Social Network Analysis 
Social  network  analysis  views  social  relationships  in  terms  of  network  theory,  consisting  of 
nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships 
between  the  individuals,  such  as  Facebook  friendships,  email  correspondence,  hyperlinks,  or 
Twitter responses) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes 
are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. 
 
Visualization  of  social  networks  is  now  coming  online  to  make  sense  of  network  data  and 
convey  the  results  of  analyses.  NodeXL  is  one  of  the  leading,  open-source  analytic  software 
modules for network visualization.  It is free, an Excel add-on, and fairly simple to use (though 
there is a learning curve). NodeXL deciphers the deluge. A network visualization, shown below, 
summarizes the software and its user manual. 
 

 

 

A Marketing Research Example 
Supermarket transactions don't jump up and yell: “social network." So it might come as a 
surprise to learn how most interactions, be they email-, Facebook-, or even food-purchase-related 
can be placed into a network diagram and analyzed.

 Network Map of NodeXLFunctionality•Social Network Map of Software Textbook•Can be applied to Social Network Data•Can analyze organizational structure/literature•Can be applied to Marketing Research VisualsNetwork visualization of transactions tells us an enormous amount about how consumers 
purchase, and can give our client invaluable marketing information on what, for example, to 
offer on special in order to boost sales of other products as well. 
 

 
Data-mining project results pack the most punch when they are delivered visually. Above is an 
example of a data-mining output for a major supermarket chain. They want to know which items 
they should put on special. 
 
When examining the supermarket’s data-mining visual, there are a few things to keep in mind: 

 

Items  are  clustered  by  transactions.  Items  with  the  same  shade  tend  to  be  purchased 
together. 

  The  thickness  of  the  red  line  indicates  the  number  of  transactions  between  its  linked 

items. Heavy red lines, big seller. Dotted connection, not as large. 

  The size of the oval represents the ‘between-item connectivity,’ not the transaction rates. 

This is what we are looking for—product influencers. We’ll explain below. 

 
Examining the graph,  we see that there are  four  ‘clusters.’ Peppers  are purchased with shrimp; 
onions with carrots; broccoli with chicken; and roast beef with mustard.

 Social Network of Supermarket Transactions•The colors of the nodes represent different clusters of products often purchased together•The size of the red connector lines represents the number of transactions•The size of the bubble represent its between group ‘Connectivity’The  managers  at  the  supermarket,  however,  would  like  to  know  which  items  they  need  to 
promote  to  increase  overall  sales.  Best-selling  items  are  not  necessarily  the  correct  answer. 
Hotdogs, for example, are a popular item. But they are connected mainly to catsup and mustard,

Sources of Information 
Today’s Big Data mining field is prodigious. More never-ending streams of data are being 
created every day then were produced for the first four thousand years of human existence. 
 
However, most sources being utilized for the marketing research industry come from a small 
number of well-known sources. 
 

 

 

This  is  true  of  Social  Network  Analysis.  In  order  to  filter  the  brand  conversation,  the  main 
sources  of  data  are  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  others  shown  in  the  chart  above.  Each 
contains one or more social networks. 
 
Social media network maps are a great way to get an overview of your own social media topics 
and  the  related  ones  that  matter  to  you.  Maps  offer  a  quick  way  to  assess  the  type  of  social 
structure that has emerged around a topic. These maps make it easy to compare the ways groups 
in your networks use URLs, hashtags, words, @usernames, and phrases.

Deciphering a Network Graph 
A network graph can be summarized by a number of metrics. NodeXL reports these measures for 
each network. These values can be a useful way to compare networks. Marc Smith, the creator of 
NodeXL, offers this summary of key metrics. 

Vertices: the count of unique entities in the network (this is the count of users or accounts) 

Unique Edges: the count of connected pairs of vertices 

Edges With Duplicates: the count of connections that are repeated 

Total Edges: the count of all connections 

Self-Loops: the count of connections that start and end in the same person (these represent 
tweets that have no other person’s name in them) 

Reciprocated Vertex Pair Ratio: the proportion of vertices or users who have a connection 
returned to them 

Reciprocated Edge Ratio: the fraction of edges that are matched by an edge in the opposite 
direction 

Connected Components: the number of distinct, isolated, sets of connected vertices 

Single-Vertex Connected Components: the count of isolate vertices, users who do not mention 
anyone 

Maximum Vertices in a Connected Component: the count of vertices within the largest set of 
connected vertices 

Maximum Edges in a Connected Component: the count of connections within the largest set 
of connected vertices. 
 
There is quite a bit of information to digest. However, the marketing researcher, the corporate 
client, and the C-Suite executive need only remember a few of these measures. These are 
summarized below.

Social network analysis is today most commonly used to mine Twitter feeds. Twitter maps have 
become the most popular and versatile social network graphs for marketing snapshots. These are 
generally  designed  to  measure  a  conversation  about  a  hashtag,  Twitter  account,  brand,  public 
policy, or more or less anything that is discussed on Twitter (which, these days, is everything). 
 
There are six basic types of Twitter Social Network Analysis maps. Please Note: In illustration 
below, "Bazaar" section should read "many medium-sized groups, some isolates"  
 

 

 

Polarized  Network:  Most  often  seen  in  politics  or  political  issues,  this  pattern  emerges  when 
two groups are split in their opinion on an issue: Two dense clusters with little interconnection. 
The map shown below was produced during the Arab Spring. It was a map with a commentary 
on the War on Women. Though the Arab  societies might have thrown off their dictatorships in 
2011,  their  deep-seated  cultural  attitudes  towards  women  have  not  changed.  However,  women 
have begun to speak up, particularly over social media.

6 kinds of Twitter social media networksThe hashtag #monaeltahawy  comes from  Mona Eltahawy. Mona is  a writer and public speaker 
on feminism and Arab and Muslim issues. The map lets us know in no uncertain terms that not 
all Arab tweeters agreed with her views of feminism in the Arab world. 
 

 

 

In-Group Network: Seen at conferences and among tightly knit groups of people, this type of 
network  rarely  ventures  outside  of  its  membership.  Here’s  the  In-Group  Twitter  map  for  the 
CASRO National Conference held in  October 7-10, 2013 in Westlake Village, California. That 
is, a map of conference attendees who were tweeting in real time about the conference using the 
hashtag #CASRO. 
 
From a marketing standpoint, in-group maps are most useful for technical products where users 
converse  over  Twitter.  In  addition,  many  new  platforms  that  are  emerging  in  the  marketing 
research industry can create hashtags for their products,  and then follow comments about those 
platforms using these twitter maps. These kinds of maps are a must for specialty brands, highly 
technical products, or specific pharmaceutical products.

The Twitter Brand Map 
Below  is  an  example  of  a  Twitter  NodeXL  Social  Network  graph.  Instead  of  using  listening 
tools, these Twitter maps organize and visualize content in a way that makes them very easy to 
interpret. 

  We can see who is talking about the brand. 
  We  can  determine  the  major  influencers  or  connectors  and  what  they  are  saying.  (A 
connector is someone whose tweets are heard by a large number of people, oftentimes in 
different ‘clouds’ within the graphic.) If we look at Graph 1, we see an oval that shows 
several connectors. 

  These are people that the brand might want to contact directly through Twitter.

#CASROIn-group / Community 

 

Given that BMW is a major brand, there are a lot of people who are talking about it who are not 
‘connected’ to other tweeters. These nodes are referred to as “islands.” Most brands will have a 
large cluster of islands. On Graph 1, G1 is the large group of dots to the left. These are people 
not  directly  connected  to  the  main  BMW  Twitter  account  but  are  discussing  topics  related  to 
BWM. These are people with whom BWM might want to talk in the future. 
 
The clusters in the BMW map, the multi-colored clouds of names, are people who are in contact 
with  each  other  either  by  retweeting  or  responding.  If  we  look  to  see  which  Twitter  hashtags 
cluster in each group we get a pretty good idea of what they are saying about BMW. 
 
What’s  exciting  about  this  is  that  NodeXL  allows  companies  to  understand  not  only  what  is 
being discussed in the social networkosphere, but also to identify their most efficient messenger. 
This allows firms to ferret out prospective customers and identify influencers, and allows brands 
to  test  social  media  campaigns  by  monitoring  NodeXL  Twitter  maps  over  specified  periods  of 
time. 
 
It would be valuable for a brand to map its Twitter feed for a month. That would give a company 
a good idea of its brand conversation on Twitter.

#BMWBrand / Public TopicBazaar Networks: Bazaar literally means ‘marketplace’. These networks were named  for their 
diverse  Twitter  clusters.  They  are  most  often  seen  with  medium-sized  companies  or  political 
issues with various levels of community involvement. Currently, a gubernatorial race is brewing 
in  Texas.  Of  course,  Texas  is  a  Red  State,  and  the  Democrat  candidate,  Wendy  Davis,  has 
become  a  lightening  rod.  This  map  was  produced  on  January  22,  2014,  the  day  after  Davis 
announced  some  ‘inconsistencies’  in  her  bio.  As  the  map  shows,  there  is  a  bazaar  of  opinions 
about the viability of the Davis candidacy. 

 

A table of the NodeXL output, which clusters hashtags and word pairs, shows differing views of 
Wendy Davis.

@WendyDavisBazaar Network 

Here is the take-home: Using Twitter maps, the clustering of the hashtags often yields the brand 
conversation, whether it is a bazaar network for a controversial political figure, such as Wendy 
Davis,  a  famous  brand,  like  the  RitzCarlton,  or  controversial  figures  such  as  Pussy  Riot  in 
Russia.  While  sentiment  analysis  might  ‘dig-down’  into  thousands  of  tweets  about  a  particular 
subject,  Social  Network  Analysis  maps  can  summarize  the  Twitter  conversation  using  its 
clustering  capabilities.  Moreover,  once  the  map  is  set,  it  can  be  run  daily  for  a  month.  The 
reports over that time period reveal the evolving internet conversation. 
 
Broadcast  Network:  This  is  another  very  useful  Twitter  map,  called  a  broadcast  map.  In  a 
broadcast  map,  an  individual  account  dominates  the  map.  Examples  might  be  Lady  Gaga,  the 
GOP, a news channel, or the Chicago Bulls. 
 
Forbes publishes a list of the Top 50 Social Influencers. These people many spend a lot of time 
on Social Networks—they are not celebrities—building the industry of Social Business. Among 
the  Top  50  Forbes  Influencers  in  the  Marketing  field  is  Ann  Handley,  the  owner  of 
@marketingprofs. Below is her Twitter Broadcast map.

month straight, the broadcast map will provide a good sense of the state of client broadcasts. 
 
Twitter Broadcast maps are also a good measure of a celebrity ‘Brand Equity’. A celebrity that 
might  have  once  been  hot  may  have  cooled  off.  One  can  tell  easily  by  scanning  up  to  18,000 
tweets and noting the number of times that celebrity is mentioned. Past celebrities, for example, 
Sarah  Palin  or  Paris  Hilton,  made  the  news  when  they  tweeted.  At  the  time  of  this  writing, 
however, I would wager that their coverage in the mainstream media would be far less extensive 
than, say, two years ago. By identifying the number of people tweeting about a subject out of the 
maximum search, NodeXL can measure the popularity of that subject. 
 
Support Network: Think customer support. These types of networks  are known  to  be good  at 
customer  service.  Organizations  such  as  the  UN  Global  fund  provide  support  for  various 
companies such as Dell Support. Below is an example support network for SAP cloud software. 
These maps are the least common found in social network analysis.

Social Network Analysis with Facebook 
In  addition  to  Twitter,  NodeXL  analyzes  email  networks,  hyperlinks,  FLICKR,  and  Facebook 
friends, ‘Likes’ pages, and groups. Below is an example of a Facebook Social Network Analysis 
map. 
 

 
 
Unlike  Twitter,  Facebook  networks  are  not  publically  available—a  password  is  required  to 
collect data from a user. Therefore, as an example, I used my own Facebook network. I do not 
use Facebook for Multivariate Solutions, so my account reflects life clusters. It is instructive to 
see how NodeXL clusters my Facebook friends. 
 
NodeXL  surveys  all  my  friends,  and  clusters  those  in  my  network  who  are  connected  to  one 
another. It then maps these people around these shared connections. 
 
Examining  my  network,  we  see  three  dominant  clusters.  One  is  my  high  school  class—the  
reason I originally got on Facebook. The second is my current social circle. The third is family. I

people who I worked with at Ristorante Alfredo in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1986 while I 
was an undergraduate at Rutgers University. 
 
Mining Facebook ‘Likes’ Pages. 
Our Social Network Analysis software has the ability to mine Facebook ‘Likes’ pages without a 
password. For major brands, such as Starbucks, thousands of likes and comments are recorded 
each day. 
 

 

In just two days, more than 360,000 likes and comments were registered on the main Starbucks 
‘Likes’ pages. By examining the above graph, we see that nearly 12,000 people visited the site. 
 
This amount of data is best synthesized by platforms that perform Sentiment Analysis; NodeXL 
would lose the nuance of the comments. 
 
Social  Network  Analysis  visualizations  using  NodeXL  would  work  wonders,  however,  with 
local  business  Facebook  pages.  Identification  and  targeting  of  local  influencers,  for  instance,  a 
local  microbrewery,  restaurant,  or  boutique  florist  could  be  performed  very  effectively.  Such  a 
client would simply surrender his or her Facebook password to be analyzed. The amount of data 
would not overwhelm NodeXL, and local influencers could be easily identified.

The World Wide Web functions as the world's largest network graph wherein web pages link to 
one another. The tens of billions of pages on the World Wide Web can each be seen as a vertex 
in a graph whose edges are URL hyperlinks connecting one page to another. There is no larger 
source of interlinked information. 
 
Professor  Robert  Ackland  of  the  Australian  National  University  highlights  the  promise  of  the 
web,  “These  hyperlinks  may  point  to  other  pages  on  the  same  web  site  or  to  sites  of  other 
organizations,  companies,  institutions,  and  nations.  The  result  is  literally  a  web  of  connections 
that is often mentioned but rarely seen. The network of related web sites, although based on basic 
“Web  1.0”  technologies,  represents  important  social,  economic,  and  institutional  relationships 
that can reveal significant insights for researchers, policy makers, and corporate strategists.” 
 
Web  pages  are  the  untapped  gold  mine  of  Big  Data  information.  An  entire  industry,  Search 
Engine Marketing, has grown up around the late 1990s internet explosion. But who your website 
is  connected  to,  and  who  connects  to  your  website,  is  really  the  mother  lode  of  network  take-
aways.  With  new  technology,  these  links  have  now  come  online  using  free,  open-source 
software. 
 
Collecting and analyzing hyperlink network data allows you to answer questions like: How does 
your organizational web presence compare with  your “offline” brand presence? How does your 
organizational web presence compare with that of your competitors? Where is the cross-branding 
taking place? 
 
Hyperlink  data  can  also  help  you  identify  new  competitors.  If  you  are  entering  a  new  market, 
these  data  can  give  you  a  sense  of  the  current  players  and  their  inter-relationships.  If  your 
organization is public affairs, what other organizations are linked to it? If you run a non-profit, 
who links to you? In other words, what is your best fundraising source? 
 
The VOSON Data Provider 
The VOSON Data Provider is  a NodeXL data import plug-in for the collection and analysis of 
hyperlink network data. It provides a front-end to a data collection and processing service that is 
part of the Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks (VOSON). This data collection 
and processing service consists of a web crawler that crawls “seed sites” nominated by the user, 
extracting  hyperlinks  to  other  sites.  The  service  also  finds  inbound  hyperlinks  to  a  given  seed 
sites. 
 
One would need to set up an account with VOSON, but a free version is available for up to ten 
databases. Of course, web crawling is nothing new. Spammers have been doing it since the dawn 
of the web. The beauty of VOSON is that it is a specialized hyperlink search service that works

within  the  framework  of  NodeXL.  The  results,  which  are  delivered  in  a  format  much  like,  for 
example,  Twitter  links,  makes  it  easy  for  non-programmers  with  a  bit  of  Excel  savvy  to  edit, 
shape, and ultimately visualize and analyze the data. 
 
Below is a hyperlink social map of our industry. Among the seed sites,

VOSON crawls the web looking for both inbound and outbound links to the seed websites. It is 
possible to control the number of links one sees. While there are space limitations, once the sites 
are crawled, the data can be downloaded into Excel in a format that NodeXL can analyze without 
a great deal of data preparation.

Hyperlink SpaceMarketing Research IndustryThe graph above was filtered, and then various links (among the 4000 or so which emerged from 
VOSON)  were  labeled.  The  results  give  us  a  picture  of  the  ‘industry  space’  of  the  limited 
marketing research websites I asked to crawl. 
 
Next,  I  decided  to  try  a  hyperlink  network  for  an  industry  that  I  do  a  lot  of  work  for,  casual 
dining restaurants. The seed sites were several of the most popular restaurants, such as the Olive 
Garden, the Cheesecake Factory, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Applebee’s, among a few others. 
 

I have circled some of the seed sites, and labeled some of the more interesting links. What our 
graph shows us are lists for employment on Craig’s List, local media reviews of restaurants, food 
blogs, college campuses where specials might have been made for a particular restaurant, and a 
link between the NHL Detroit Redwings, who co-branded with Applebee’s under the banner of 
“Applebee's, Your Home for Hockey - Detroit Red Wings - Fan Zone”. 
 
The main advantage of hyperlink network analysis is that it is not as fluid as, say, Twitter. One 
can run a web crawl for an industry space and be fairly sure that the structure will be intact for a

media, and “Web 2.0” applications. 
 
Research Challenges for Social Network Analysis 
Personal  Twitter  networks  can  only  be  mined  to  a  limited  extent.  Currently,  the  Twitter  API 
(application  programming  interface)  imposes  severe  limits  on  this  activity.  Let's  say,  for 
instance, that  you  are  interested  in who is  following a particular  account  rather than in  what  is 
being  tweeted.  Twitter  imposes  strict  limits  on  how  many  links  you  may  download  in  a  15-
minute time span. In practice, that would mean that downloading a meaningful Twitter account 
network would take  days—and often the API will cut  off  your access  in  the middle. Efforts  to 
streamline the Twitter API are underway. However, at this time, the limits are still in place. 
 
Additionally  a  low-tech  challenge,  attention  span,  must  also  be  considered.  Corporate  brand 
managers and C-suite executives have been slow to embrace this new technology. They glance at 
a Twitter map and say "That’s nice, what does it mean?" The explanation, though, can take a few 
minutes. 
 
Researchers  are  racing  to  design  easily  deployable  deliverables.  When  we  can  explain  in  one 
sentence  the  meaning  of  a  ‘brand  conversation’  or  an  ‘internet  industry  space,’  then  large 
corporations will adopt the new techniques and add them to their existing arsenal of marketing 
research applications. 
 
Conclusion 
We  are  living  in  an  increasingly  saturated  world.  Facebook,  Twitter,  Google,  smartphones—
there is so much marketing noise that even big TV networks and news giants no longer have the 
ability to guarantee overnight product success. 
 
The result is a growing effort by smart organizations to augment their campaigns through proven 
media  channels  with  social  network  analysis.  That  is,  these  companies  have  learned  to  harness 
the power of thought leaders, experts, and influencers to promote their products. Social network 
analysis plays a starring role in the forthcoming drama.
