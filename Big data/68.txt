ABSTRACT
This tutorial gives an overview on state-of-the-art methods
for the automatic construction of large knowledge bases and
harnessing them for data and text analytics. It covers both
big-data methods for building knowledge bases and knowl-
edge bases being assets for big-data applications. The tuto-
rial also points out challenges and research opportunities.
1. MOTIVATION AND SCOPE

Comphrehensive machine-readable knowledge bases (KB’s)
have been pursued since the seminal projects Cyc [19, 20]
and WordNet [12].
In contrast to these manually created
KB’s, great advances have recently been made on automat-
ing the building and curation of large KB’s [1, 16], using
information extraction (IE) techniques and harnessing high-
quality Web sources like Wikipedia. Prominent endeavors
of this kind include academic research projects such as DB-
pedia [3], KnowItAll [10], NELL [5] and YAGO [29], as well
as industrial ones such as Freebase. These projects provide
automatically constructed KB’s of facts about named enti-
ties, their semantic classes, and their mutual relationships.
They contain millions of entities and billions of facts about
them. Moreover, several KB’s are interlinked at the en-
tity level, forming the backbone of the Web of Linked Data
[14]. Such world knowledge in turn enables cognitive appli-
cations and knowledge-centric services like disambiguating
natural-language text, entity linking, text summarization,
deep question answering, and semantic search and analytics
over entities and relations in Web and enterprise data (e.g.,
[2, 6, 8, 13]). Prominent examples of how KB’s can be har-
nessed include the Google Knowledge Graph [27] and the
IBM Watson question answering system [17].

This tutorial presents state-of-the-art methods, recent ad-
vances, research opportunities, and open challenges along
this avenue of knowledge harvesting and its applications.
Particular emphasis is on the twofold role of KB’s for big-
data analytics: using scalable distributed algorithms for har-
vesting knowledge from Web and text sources, and leverag-
ing entity-centric knowledge for deeper interpretation of and

2. BUILDING KNOWLEDGE BASES

Digital Knowledge: Today’s KB’s represent their data
mostly in RDF-style SPO (subject-predicate-object) triples.
We introduce this data model and the most salient KB
projects, which include KnowItAll [10, 11], BabelNet [22],
ConceptNet [28], DBpedia [3, 18], DeepDive [24], Freebase
[4], ImageNet [7], NELL [5], Wikidata [31], WikiNet [21],
WikiTaxonomy [26], and YAGO [29, 15]. We brieﬂy dis-
cuss industrial projects like the Google Knowledge Graph
and related work at Google [9, 13, 25], the EntityCube and
Probase projects at Microsoft Research [23, 32], and IBM’s
Watson project [17].

Harvesting Knowledge on Entities and Classes: Ev-
ery entity in a KB (e.g., Steve Jobs) belongs to one or mul-
tiple classes (e.g., computer pioneer, entrepreneur). These
classes are organized into a taxonomy, where more special
classes are subsumed by more general classes (e.g., person).
We discuss two families of methods to harvest such informa-
tion: Wikipedia-based approaches that analyze the category
system, and Web-based approaches that use techniques like
set expansion.
3. HARVESTING FACTS AT WEB SCALE
Harvesting Relational Facts: Relational facts express
properties of and relationships between entities. There is a
large spectrum of methods to extract such facts from Web
documents. We give an overview on methods from pattern
matching (e.g., regular expressions), computational linguis-
tics (e.g., dependency parsing), statistical learning (e.g., fac-
tor graphs and MLN’s), and logical consistency reasoning
(e.g., weighted MaxSat or ILP solvers). We also discuss to
what extent these approaches scale to handle big data.

Open Information Extraction: Alternatively to meth-
ods that operate on a pre-speciﬁed set of relations and en-
tities, open information extraction harvests arbitrary SPO
triples from natural language documents.
It aggressively
taps into noun phrases as entity candidates and verbal phrases
as prototypic patterns for relations. We discuss recent meth-
ods that follow this direction. Some methods along these
lines make clever use of big-data techniques like frequent
sequence mining and map-reduce computation.

Temporal and Multilingual Knowledge: Properly
interpreting entities and facts in a KB often requires ad-
ditional meta-information like entity names in diﬀerent lan-
guages and the temporal scope of facts. We discuss tech-

2. BUILDING KNOWLEDGE BASES

Digital Knowledge: Today’s KB’s represent their data
mostly in RDF-style SPO (subject-predicate-object) triples.
We introduce this data model and the most salient KB
projects, which include KnowItAll [10, 11], BabelNet [22],
ConceptNet [28], DBpedia [3, 18], DeepDive [24], Freebase
[4], ImageNet [7], NELL [5], Wikidata [31], WikiNet [21],

cuss industrial projects like the Google Knowledge Graph
and related work at Google [9, 13, 25], the EntityCube and
Probase projects at Microsoft Research [23, 32], and IBM’s
Watson project [17].

ery entity in a KB (e.g., Steve Jobs) belongs to one or mul-
tiple classes (e.g., computer pioneer, entrepreneur). These
classes are organized into a taxonomy, where more special
classes are subsumed by more general classes (e.g., person).
We discuss two families of methods to harvest such informa-
tion: Wikipedia-based approaches that analyze the category
system, and Web-based approaches that use techniques like
set expansion.
3. HARVESTING FACTS AT WEB SCALE
Harvesting Relational Facts: Relational facts express
properties of and relationships between entities. There is a
large spectrum of methods to extract such facts from Web
documents. We give an overview on methods from pattern
matching (e.g., regular expressions), computational linguis-
tics (e.g., dependency parsing), statistical learning (e.g., fac-
tor graphs and MLN’s), and logical consistency reasoning
(e.g., weighted MaxSat or ILP solvers). We also discuss to
what extent these approaches scale to handle big data.

Open Information Extraction: Alternatively to meth-
ods that operate on a pre-speciﬁed set of relations and en-
tities, open information extraction harvests arbitrary SPO
triples from natural language documents.

taps into noun phrases as entity candidates and verbal phrases
as prototypic patterns for relations. We discuss recent meth-
ods that follow this direction. Some methods along these
lines make clever use of big-data techniques like frequent
sequence mining and map-reduce computation.

Temporal and Multilingual Knowledge: Properly
interpreting entities and facts in a KB often requires ad-
ditional meta-information like entity names in diﬀerent lan-
guages and the temporal scope of facts. We discuss tech-

niques for tapping multilingual Web sources, and we cover
techniques for extracting temporal expressions and for in-
ferring the timepoints of events and timespans during which
certain facts hold.

Commonsense Knowledge: Current KB’s focus on facts
about entities. However, there is an orthogonal dimension
of commonsense that machines should acquire, too. This
includes relations between concepts (e.g., mouthpiece partOf
clarinet, clarinet hasShape cylindrical), properties of concepts
that every child knows but are not obvious to a computer
(e.g., the statement that apples can be red, green, juicy,
sweet, sour, but not fast or funny), and also commonsense
rules (e.g., the assertion that the father of a mother’s child
is usually the husband or partner of the mother as of the
child’s birth). We discuss methods for acquiring such kinds
of commonsense knowledge.
4. KNOWLEDGE FOR BIG DATA

When analytic tasks tap into text or Web data, it is often
crucial to identify entities (people, places, products, etc.) in
the input for proper grouping and other purposes. An exam-
ple application could aim to track and compare two entities
in social media over an extended timespan (e.g., the Ap-
ple iPhone vs. Samsung Galaxy families). In this context,
knowledge about entities is a key asset.

Named Entity Disambiguation: With text or tables
as input, entities are ﬁrst seen only in surface form: by
names (e.g., “Jobs”) or phrases (e.g., “the Apple founder”).
Such entity mentions are often ambiguous; mapping them
to canonicalized entities registered in a KB is the task of
named-entity disambiguation (NED). State-of-the-art NED
methods combine context similarity between the surround-
ings of a mention and salient phrases associated with an
entity, with coherence measures for two or more entities
co-occurring together. Although these principles are well
understood, NED remains an active research area towards
improving robustness, scalability, and coverage.

Entity Linkage: Even when entities are explicitly marked
in (semi-) structured data, the problem arises to tell whether
two entities are the same or not. This is a variant of the
record-linkage problem (aka. entity matching, entity reso-
lution, entity de-duplication). For KB’s and Linked Open
Data, the goal is to generate and maintain owl:sameAs in-
formation across knowledge resources at large scale. We give
an overview of approaches to this end, covering statistical
learning approaches and graph algorithms.
