Just-released MegaODA™ software is capable of conducting UniODA 
analysis  for  an  unlimited  number  of  attributes  using  samples  as  large 
as  one  million  observations.  To  minimize  the  computational  burden 
associated  with  Monte  Carlo  simulation  used  to  estimate  the  Type  I 
error rate (p), the first  step in  statistical  analysis  is  identifying effects 
that  are  not  statistically  significant  or  ns.  This  article  presents  an 
experimental simulation exploring the ability of MegaODA to identify 
ns effects in a host of designs involving a binary class variable, under 
ultimately challenging discrimination conditions (all data are random) 
for  sample  sizes  of  n=100,000  and  n=1,000,000.  Most  analyses  were 
solved in CPU seconds running MegaODA on a 3 GHz Intel Pentium 
D  microcomputer.  Using  MegaODA  it  is  straightforward  to  rapidly 
rule-out ns effects using Monte Carlo simulation with BIG DATA for 
large numbers of attributes in simple or complex, single- or multiple-
sample  designs  involving  categorical  or  ordered  attributes  either  with 
or without weights being applied to individual observations. 

 

For this research a data set was constructed with 
three  independently  generated  random  numbers 
provided for each of 106 observations. The first 
variable  was  binary,  created  using  a  random 
probability  value  (p)  generated  from  a  uniform 
distribution: BINARY=0 if p<0.05; BINARY=1 
if  p>0.05.  The  second  variable  was  an  ordered 
5-point  Likert-type  scale1  created  using  another 
random p generated from a uniform distribution: 
LIKERT=1  if  p<0.2;  LIKERT=2  if  0.2<p<0.4; 
LIKERT=3  if  0.4<p<0.6;  LIKERT=4  if  0.6<p< 
0.8; and LIKERT=5 if p>0.8. The third and final 
variable is a constrained real-number created as 
yet  another  random  probability  value  generated 
from a uniform distribution: RANDOM=p.

Observations were assigned a unique ID 
number,  an  integer  between  1  and  106  used  to 
segment  the  sample:  two  analyses  are  reported, 
the  first  for  observations  with  ID<100,000,  and 
the  second  for  the  complete  sample.  The  trials 
begin  using the former sample, which might  be 
described as being  relatively large as compared 
with the typical  empirical research published in 
peer-reviewed literature.

time  trials  treated  LIKERT  as  being  an  ordinal 
attribute  with  five  discrete  response  categories, 
another  design  that  is  prevalently  used  across 
quantitative disciplines.

(the model identified was identical to the model 
for the corresponding categorical analysis).

associated  with  Monte  Carlo  simulation  used  to  estimate  the  Type  I

experimental simulation exploring the ability of MegaODA to identify 
ns effects in a host of designs involving a binary class variable, under 
ultimately challenging discrimination conditions (all data are random) 
for  sample  sizes  of  n=100,000  and  n=1,000,000.  Most  analyses  were

For this research a data set was constructed with

random p generated from a uniform distribution: 
LIKERT=1  if  p<0.2;  LIKERT=2  if  0.2<p<0.4; 
LIKERT=3  if  0.4<p<0.6;  LIKERT=4  if  0.6<p< 
0.8; and LIKERT=5 if p>0.8. The third and final 
variable is a constrained real-number created as

from a uniform distribution: RANDOM=p.

Categorical attribute. In the first pair of 
time trials LIKERT was treated as a categorical 
attribute  with  five  response  categories.  Widely 
seen across quantitative fields this configuration 
is called a rectangular categorical design.2 

The post hoc hypothesis that class can be 
discriminated using categorical LIKERT scores 
was tested by running the following MegaODA 
code (control commands are indicated in red): 

   OPEN total.dat; 
   OUTPUT total.out; 
   VARS id binary likert random; 
   CLASS binary; 
   ATTR likert; 
   CAT likert; 
   EX id>100000; 
   MC ITER 1000 TARGET .05 STOPUP 99.9; 
   GO; 

Monte Carlo simulation is parameterized 
to  target  generalized  “per-comparison”  p<0.05 
for  a  single  test  of  a  statistical  hypothesis.1  A 
maximum  allowance  of  1000  MC  experiments

is  indicated.    STOPUP  ceases  simulation  when 
specified  confidence  that  estimated  p  exceeds 
target p is achieved.1 Analysis stopped after 100 
MC iterations: estimated p<0.23, confidence for 
target  p>0.10  is  >99.9%.  With  negligible  ESS 
(0.65)  and  ESP  (0.68),  the  model  required  <1 
CPU second to  solve (analyses  herein were run 
on a 3 GHz Intel Pentium D microcomputer). A 
LOO  “leave-one-out”  jackknife  analysis1  that 
was conducted in a separate run finished in less 
than one CPU second. 

The post hoc hypothesis that class can be 
discriminated using categorical LIKERT scores, 
with observations weighted by a continuous var-
iable (RANDOM), was tested by adding the fol-
lowing code. 

   WEIGHT random; 
   GO; 

Analysis  stopped  at  200  MC  iterations: 
estimated  p<0.12,  confidence  for  target  p>0.05 
is  >99.99%.  Having  a  negligible  weighted  ESS 
(0.91) and ESP (0.95), the model needed 1 CPU 
second  to  finish.  LOO  analysis  is  not  available 
for weighted categorical designs.1 

Ordinal attribute. The second set of two 
time  trials  treated  LIKERT  as  being  an  ordinal 
attribute  with  five  discrete  response  categories, 
another  design  that  is  prevalently  used  across 
quantitative disciplines.  

The post hoc hypothesis that class can be 
discriminated  via  ordinal  LIKERT  scores  was 
tested  by  using  the  prior  MegaODA  code  with 
WEIGHT and CAT commands commented-out. 

   *CAT likert; 
   *WEIGHT random; 
   GO; 

Analysis  stopped  in  300  MC  iterations: 
estimated p<0.094; confidence for target p>0.05 
is >99.9%. With negligible ESS (0.65) and ESP 
(0.68), the model took 2 CPU seconds to  finish 
(the model identified was identical to the model 
for the corresponding categorical analysis).

The post hoc hypothesis that class can be 
discriminated with ordinal LIKERT scores, with 
observations  weighted  by  a  continuous  variable 
(RANDOM), was tested by amending the code. 

   WEIGHT random; 
   GO; 

Analysis stopped at 1000 MC iterations: 
estimated p<0.026, confidence for target p>0.05 
is  >0.1%.  With  negligible  weighted  ESS  (0.91) 
and  ESP  (0.95),  the  model  needed  6  CPU  sec-
onds  to  complete.  MC  simulation  also  reported 
confidence for target p<0.05 is >99.99%. 

Continuous  attribute.  The  third  set  of 
two  time  trials  treated  RANDOM  as  being  a 
continuous  attribute,  another  design  frequently 
used across quantitative disciplines.  

The post hoc hypothesis that class can be 
discriminated  via  continuous  RANDOM  scores 
was tested by prior code amended as shown. 

   ATTR random; 
   *WEIGHT random; 
   GO; 

Analysis  stopped  in  100  MC  iterations: 
estimated  p<0.21;  confidence  for  target  p>0.10 
is >99.9%. With negligible ESS (0.65) and ESP 
(0.79) the model took 99 CPU seconds to finish.

able (RANDOM), amending the code. 

   WEIGHT likert; 
   GO; 

Analysis  stopped  in  100  MC  iterations: 
estimated  p<0.72,  confidence  for  target  p>0.10 
is  >99.99%.  Having  a  negligible  weighted  ESS 
(0.66)  and  ESP  (0.80),  the  model  needed  49 
CPU seconds to finish. 

Multiple-sample analysis. The final time 
trial for large samples used the UniODA Gener-
alizability  (Gen)  procedure  which  identifies  the 

 

196 

UniODA model that—when it is simultaneously 
applied  to  multiple  samples,  maximizes  the 
minimum  ESS  achieved  by  the  model  across 
classes.1 The post hoc hypothesis  that class can 
be  discriminated  by  a  single  model  involving  a 
continuous attribute (RANDOM) independently 
applied to five different samples (LIKERT) was 
tested via the following MegaODA code. 

   CLASS binary; 
   ATTR random; 
   GEN likert; 
   GO; 

 
Analysis  stopped  in  100  MC  iterations: 
estimated  p<0.33;  confidence  for  target  p>0.10 
is  >99.99%.  Having  negligible  ESS  (0.49)  and 
ESP (1.13) the model required 78 CPU seconds.

Categorical  attribute.  Analysis  for  the 
 
post  hoc  hypothesis  that  class  can  be  discrimi-
nated using categorical LIKERT scores stopped 
after  100  MC  iterations:  estimated  p<0.19, 
confidence  for  target  p>0.05  is  >99.99%.  With 
negligible ESS (0.20) and ESP (0.21), the model 
required 3 CPU seconds to solve. LOO analysis 
conducted in a separate run required less than 1 
CPU second to complete. 

Analysis for the post hoc hypothesis that 
class  can  be  discriminated  using  categorical

dence for target p>0.05 is >99.99%. With negli-
gible  weighted  ESS  (0.26)  and  ESP  (0.27),  the

dence for target p>0.05 is >47.69%, confidence 
for  p<0.05  is  >52.31%.  Having  a  negligible 
weighted ESS (0.26) and ESP (0.27), the model 
required  144  CPU  seconds  to  solve.  This  is  an 
example of the worst-case (most resource inten-
sive)  scenario.  At  this  point  the  attribute  would 
be  subjected  to  a  much  more  computationally 
intensive  MC  simulation3  as  will  be  studied  in 
forthcoming rule-in time trials.
