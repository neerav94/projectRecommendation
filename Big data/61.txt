1.  Introduction

Recent  technological  revolutions  such  as  social  media  enable 
us  to  generate  data  much  faster  than  ever  before  [28].  The  no-
tion  of  big  data  and  its  application  in  business  intelligence  have 
attracted enormous attention in recent years because of its great 
potential in generating business impacts [12]. “Big Data” is deﬁned 
as “the amount of data just beyond technology’s capability to store, 
manage and process eﬃciently” [21]. Big data can be characterized 
along  three  important  dimensions,  namely  volume,  velocity,  and 
variety [38].

In  marketing  intelligence,  which  emphasizes  the  marketing-
related  aspects  of  business  intelligence,  data  relevant  to  a  com-
pany’s  markets  is  collected  and  processed  into  insights  that  sup-
port decision-making [19]. Marketing intelligence has traditionally 
relied  on  market  surveys  to  understand  consumer  behavior  and 
improve  product  design.  For  example,  companies  use  consumer 
satisfaction surveys to study customer attitudes. With big data an-
alytic  technologies,  key  factors  for  strategic  marketing  decisions, 
such as customer opinions toward a product, service, or company, 
can be automatically monitored by mining social media data [35].
However, while accessibility to big data creates unprecedented 
opportunities  for  marketing  intelligence,  it  also  brings  challenges

to practitioners and researchers. Big data analytics is mainly con-
cerned with three types of challenges: storage, management, and 
processing  [21].  For  typical  marketing  intelligence  tasks  such  as 
customer opinion mining, companies nowadays have many differ-
ent ways (social media data, transactional data, survey data, sensor 
network  data,  etc.)  to  collect  data  from  a  variety  of  information 
sources.  Based  on  the  characteristics  of  collected  data,  different 
methods can be applied to discover marketing intelligence. Anal-
ysis  models  developed  based  on  a  single  data  source  may  only 
provide limited insights, leading to potentially biased business de-
cisions. On the other hand, integrating heterogeneous information 
from different sources provides a holistic view of the domain and 
generates more accurate marketing intelligence. Unfortunately, in-
tegrating  big  data  from  multiple  sources  to  generate  marketing 
intelligence is not a trivial task. This prompts exploration of new 
methods, applications, and frameworks for effective big data man-
agement in the context of marketing intelligence.

We investigate different perspectives of marketing intelligence 
and propose a framework to manage big data in this context. We 
ﬁrst identify popular data sources for marketing intelligence per-
spectives. Then, we summarize the methods that are suitable for 
different data sources and marketing perspectives. Finally, we give 
examples  of  applications  in  different  perspectives.  The  proposed 
framework provides guidelines for companies to select appropriate 
data  sources  and  methods  for  managing  vital  marketing  intelli-
gence to meet their strategic goals.

2.  A big data management framework

The marketing mix framework is a well-known framework that 
identiﬁes the principal components of marketing decisions, and it 
has dominated marketing thought, research, and practice [6]. Bor-
den [5] has been recognized as the ﬁrst to use the term “marketing 
mix”  and  he  proposed  a  set  of  12  elements.  McCarthy  [29] re-
grouped  Borden’s  12  elements  to  four  elements  or  4Ps,  namely 
product, price, promotion, and place. The 4P model has been con-
sidered to be most relevant for consumer marketing. However, it 
has  been  criticized  as  being  a  production-oriented  deﬁnition  of 
marketing,  and  researchers  proposed  a  ﬁfth  P  (people)  [18].  We 
adopt the 5P model of the marketing mix framework in this paper 
because  these  perspectives  play  critical  roles  in  developing  suc-
cessful marketing strategies in the information age.

In this paper, we propose a marketing mix framework to man-
age  big  data  for  marketing  intelligence.  This  model  classiﬁes  the 
research  in  marketing  intelligence  into  ﬁve  perspectives  accord-
ing to the marketing mix framework. Further, we identify common 
data,  methods,  and  applications  in  each  perspective  and  high-
light  the  dominating  big  data  characteristic  with  respect  to  each 
perspective.  This  framework  provides  guidelines  for  marketing 
decision-making based on big data analytics. Fig. 1 is an overview 
of  the  proposed  big  data  management  framework  for  marketing 
intelligence. First, data from various sources are retrieved and uti-
lized to generate vital marketing intelligence. Second, a variety of 
analytics methods are applied to convert raw big data to actionable 
marketing  knowledge  (intelligence).  Finally,  both  data  and  meth-
ods are combined to support marketing applications with respect 
to each perspective of the marketing mix model.

2.1.  Data

Researchers  use  various  methods  to  collect  data,  such  as  sur-
veys, interviews, focus groups, observations, and archives [2]. Note 
that data collection methods are different from research methods. 
For  example,  experiments  are  a  widely  used  research  method  in 
marketing,  but  researchers  rely  on  surveys,  observations,  or  in-
terviews  to  collect  experimental  data  [27].  Surveys  and  logs  are 
the  two  most  common  methods  to  acquire  data  for  business  in-
telligence  [22].  A  survey  is  deﬁned  as  “collecting  information  in 
an  organized  and  methodical  manner  about  characteristics  of  in-

terest  from  some  or  all  units  of  a  population  using  well-deﬁned 
concepts,  methods  and  procedures,  and  compiles  such  informa-
tion into a useful summary form” [10]. Firms use surveys to col-
lect  data  for  various  purposes,  such  as  understanding  customers’ 
preferences  and  behaviors.  For  example,  Apple  has  sent  surveys 
to customers who recently purchased an iPhone to gain feedback 
about their purchase and their experience with the product [16]. 
Log data is generated by information systems that capture trans-
actional records and user behavior [20]. For example, Walmart has 
started  to  explore  analyzing  social  media  data  to  gain  customer 
opinions about the company or a particular product [7]. Log data 
and  survey  data  can  be  different  in  terms  of  size,  quality,  fre-
quency,  objectives,  contents,  and  processing  techniques  [37].  The 
two  data  collection  methods  complement  each  other  in  various 
business contexts. Surveys can be useful when we want to collect 
data on phenomena that cannot be directly observed. Log data are 
preferred when real-time conclusions about users’ actual behavior 
are  required.  The  two  methods  can  be  combined  when  we  want 
to study the relationship between user intention and user behav-
ior. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods, and 
we  believe  big  data  management  should  take  both  methods  into 
consideration.

2.2.  Methods

Marketing  intelligence  refers  to  developing  insights  from  data 
for  marketing  decision-making.  Data  mining  techniques  can  help 
to  accomplish  such  a  goal  by  extracting  or  detecting patterns  or 
forecasting  customer  behavior  from  large databases.  According  to 
the data mining literature, common data mining methods include 
association  mining,  classiﬁcation,  clustering,  and  regression  [31]. 
We need to select appropriate data mining methods based on the 
data characteristics and business problems [25].

2.3.  Applications

2.3.1.  Customer segmentation and customer proﬁling

For  effective  marketing,  it  is  essential  to  identify  a  speciﬁc 
group  of  customers  who  share  similar  preferences  and  respond 
to a speciﬁc marketing signal. Customer segmentation applications 
can  help  identify  different  communities  (segments)  of  customers 
who may share similar interests. Kim et al. [23] proposed cluster-

For  effective  marketing,  it  is  essential  to  identify  a  speciﬁc 
group  of  customers  who  share  similar  preferences  and  respond 
to a speciﬁc marketing signal. Customer segmentation applications 
can  help  identify  different  communities  (segments)  of  customers 
who may share similar interests. Kim et al. [23] proposed cluster-

30

S. Fan et al. / Big Data Research 2 (2015) 28–32

ing customer groups with respect to lifecycle characteristics. Usu-
ally, various clustering and classiﬁcation techniques are applied to 
customer segmentation and user proﬁling. However, customer seg-
mentation  is  becoming  increasingly  challenging  under  a  big  data 
environment. For instance, to differentiate among customer groups 
for telecommunication applications, it is necessary to analyze their 
call  data  apart  from  their  demographics  [1].  The  volume  of  call 
data is huge (e.g., the communication time between each pair of 
customers on each day), and a variety of data should be taken into 
account  (e.g.,  both  qualitative  demographic  data  and  quantitative 
call records). In fact, for the most ﬁne-grained targeted marketing 
(e.g., one-to-one marketing), we are not talking about identifying 
groups of similar customers, but the “proﬁling” of each individual 
customer  such  that  the  most  suitable  products/services  are  mar-
keted to the most appropriate individual given a steam of customer 
service consumption data generated in real-time [1].

2.3.2.  Product ontology and product reputation management

To alleviate the shortcoming of retrieving limited product rep-
utation  via  survey  data,  Morinaga  et  al.  [30] developed  an  auto-
matic framework to monitor the reputation of a variety of products 
by mining Web contents. Clustering and association mining tech-
niques are among the most common methods employed to support 
reputation management applications. More recently, Di et al. [14]
proposed a reputation management method which not only mines 
text-based  reputation  data  from  the  Web  but  also  considers  the 
graphical images of products posted to the Web. Nevertheless, by 
the time of this writing, twenty billion images have been uploaded 
to Instagram.1 Given such an extraordinary size of images archived 
online, it is extremely challenging to analyze the sheer volume of 
images  for  product  reputation  management,  not  to  mention  the 
variety  of  formats  of  source  data  (e.g.,  text  versus  images).  To 
carry  out  an  automatic  analysis  of  the  textual  comments  posted 
to  the  Web  for  product  reputation  management,  it  is  essential 
to  develop  a  rich  computer-based  representation  of  product  in-
formation for subsequent product reputation analysis. Recently, an 
automated  product  ontology  mining  method  that  is  underpinned 
by latent topic modeling has been explored to build product on-
tologies based on textual descriptions of products extracted from 
online  social  media  [24].  The  automatically  constructed  product 
ontologies can be used as the basis to support product reputation 
management  applications  and  other  marketing  intelligence  appli-
cations.  However,  given  the  computational  complexities  involved 
in automated product ontology extraction from online social me-
dia, new computational methods must be developed to cope with 
the volume, velocity, and variety issues of big social media data.

2.3.3.  Promotional marketing analysis and recommender systems

In  the  increasingly  competitive  business  environment,  billions 
of  dollars  are  spent  on  promotions  each  year  [34].  Thus,  promo-
tional marketing analysis has attracted a lot of attention from prac-
titioners and researchers. Effective promotional strategies are one 
of the key success factors for companies to increase their sales and 
revenue  [4].  Promotional  data  usually  includes  information  about 
promotion types (price cut or coupons), promotion time, and pur-
chase  records  during  the  promotional  period.  Early  work  related 
to  promotional  marketing  analysis  mostly  focused  on  analyzing 
how different types of customers respond to different promotional 
strategies or how different categories of products affect the effec-
tiveness  of  promotional  strategies  [33].  Most  existing  work  uses 
regression methods to study promotions in different contexts [4].

In the big data environment, more log data becomes/is available 
for promotion analysis. A recent work studied WOM derived from

both customer reviews and promotions [26]. The authors found a 
substitute relationship between the WOM volume and coupon of-
ferings, but a complementary relationship between WOM volume 
and keyword advertising. Promotional marketing analysis can also 
include  factors  from  other  perspectives,  such  as  price  and  place. 
For  example,  enabled  by  mobile  technologies  and  location-based 
services, companies can use customers’ location information to im-
prove their promotion strategy and select targeted customers.

To improve product awareness and promote products to poten-
tial  customers,  recommender  systems  have  been  widely  used  in 
the  e-commerce  context  [15].  User  rating-based  collaborative  ﬁl-
tering methods or content-based association mining methods are 
commonly applied to develop recommender systems. However, ex-
isting methods may not scale up to big data. For instance, given N
user ratings, the general computational complexity of a collabora-
tive ﬁltering method is N2 [9]. Therefore, it is quite challenging to 
scale up existing recommender systems to cope with big data (e.g., 
N = tens of millions)  and  generate  appropriate  recommendations 
to  potential  customers  in  real-time  as  expected  in  e-commerce 
settings. This is the reason why “velocity” is one of the most chal-
lenging  issues  for  the  “promotion”  perspective  in  the  context  of 
marketing intelligence.

2.3.4.  Pricing strategy and competitor analysis

There has been much research on what pricing strategies man-
agers should follow under various situations. Traditionally, empir-
ical research on pricing strategies uses survey data and regression 
methods. For example, researchers used a national mail survey to 
study the determinants of pricing strategies [32]. They found dif-
ferent  pricing  strategies  are  preferred  under  different  marketing 
situations.  The  growth  of  e-commerce  has  made  price  informa-
tion  available  on  websites  and  researchers  started  using  log  data 
to study pricing strategy in e-commerce websites. For example, a 
recent study uses a method to estimate demand levels from sales 
rank and derive demand elasticity, variable costs, and the optimal-
ity of pricing choices directly from publicly available e-commerce 
data [17]. Based on the data derived from various log data sources, 
they  can  study  the  optimality  of  price  discrimination.  While  re-
gression methods are widely used for price prediction applications, 
association mining methods are applied to competitor analysis ap-
plications. An automated competitor analysis application does not 
simply  identify  the  potential  competitors  of  a  company;  it  also 
effectively discovers the potentially competitive products and the 
product contexts [3]. This type of application has proven useful to 
facilitate the “price” aspect of the marketing mix model. However, 
the sheer volume of product pricing information on the Web has 
also  posed  new  challenges  to  scale  up  existing  applications  with 
big data.

2.3.5.  Location-based advertising and community dynamic analysis

Place is also an important dimension in marketing analysis. Re-
search on place-based marketing focuses on the impact of places 
on  marketing  strategies.  For  example,  researchers  used  a  survey 
to collect customer data and study different levels of place-based 
marketing in the form of region of origin strategies used by winer-
ies in their branding efforts [8].

With the widespread use of mobile technology, location-based 
services (LBS) can provide users personalized information in a spe-
ciﬁc  location  at  a  speciﬁc  time.  Location-based  advertising  has 
been proposed as an eﬃcient marketing strategy [13,27]. Location 
is one of the most important solutions to meet consumers’ need 
and  it  is  a  valuable  source  for  personalized  marketing  informa-
tion.  In  location-based  advertising,  customers  can  get  timely  ad-
vertisements or product recommendations based on their current 
position  or  predicted  future  position.  Location-based  advertising 
provides a new tool for companies to attract more customers and

Big data analytics have been embraced as a disruptive technology that will reshape business intelligence, 
which  is  a  domain  that  relies  on  data  analytics  to  gain  business  insights  for  better  decision-making. 
Rooted in the recent literature, we investigate the landscape of big data analytics through the lens of a 
marketing mix framework in this paper. We identify the data sources, methods, and applications related 
to ﬁve important marketing perspectives, namely people, product, place, price, and promotion, that lay 
the foundation for marketing intelligence. We then discuss several challenging research issues and future 
directions of research in big data analytics and marketing related business intelligence in general.

1.  Introduction

Recent  technological  revolutions  such  as  social  media  enable 
us  to  generate  data  much  faster  than  ever  before  [28].  The  no-
tion  of  big  data  and  its  application  in  business  intelligence  have 
attracted enormous attention in recent years because of its great 
potential in generating business impacts [12]. “Big Data” is deﬁned 
as “the amount of data just beyond technology’s capability to store, 
manage and process eﬃciently” [21]. Big data can be characterized 
along  three  important  dimensions,  namely  volume,  velocity,  and 
variety [38].

In  marketing  intelligence,  which  emphasizes  the  marketing-
related  aspects  of  business  intelligence,  data  relevant  to  a  com-
pany’s  markets  is  collected  and  processed  into  insights  that  sup-
port decision-making [19]. Marketing intelligence has traditionally 
relied  on  market  surveys  to  understand  consumer  behavior  and 
improve  product  design.  For  example,  companies  use  consumer 
satisfaction surveys to study customer attitudes. With big data an-
alytic  technologies,  key  factors  for  strategic  marketing  decisions, 
such as customer opinions toward a product, service, or company, 
can be automatically monitored by mining social media data [35].
However, while accessibility to big data creates unprecedented 
opportunities  for  marketing  intelligence,  it  also  brings  challenges

to practitioners and researchers. Big data analytics is mainly con-
cerned with three types of challenges: storage, management, and 
processing  [21].  For  typical  marketing  intelligence  tasks  such  as 
customer opinion mining, companies nowadays have many differ-
ent ways (social media data, transactional data, survey data, sensor 
network  data,  etc.)  to  collect  data  from  a  variety  of  information 
sources.  Based  on  the  characteristics  of  collected  data,  different 
methods can be applied to discover marketing intelligence. Anal-
ysis  models  developed  based  on  a  single  data  source  may  only 
provide limited insights, leading to potentially biased business de-
cisions. On the other hand, integrating heterogeneous information 
from different sources provides a holistic view of the domain and 
generates more accurate marketing intelligence. Unfortunately, in-
tegrating  big  data  from  multiple  sources  to  generate  marketing 
intelligence is not a trivial task. This prompts exploration of new 
methods, applications, and frameworks for effective big data man-
agement in the context of marketing intelligence.

We investigate different perspectives of marketing intelligence 
and propose a framework to manage big data in this context. We 
ﬁrst identify popular data sources for marketing intelligence per-
spectives. Then, we summarize the methods that are suitable for 
different data sources and marketing perspectives. Finally, we give 
examples  of  applications  in  different  perspectives.  The  proposed 
framework provides guidelines for companies to select appropriate 
data  sources  and  methods  for  managing  vital  marketing  intelli-
gence to meet their strategic goals.

2.  A big data management framework

The marketing mix framework is a well-known framework that 
identiﬁes the principal components of marketing decisions, and it 
has dominated marketing thought, research, and practice [6]. Bor-
den [5] has been recognized as the ﬁrst to use the term “marketing 
mix”  and  he  proposed  a  set  of  12  elements.  McCarthy  [29] re-
grouped  Borden’s  12  elements  to  four  elements  or  4Ps,  namely 
product, price, promotion, and place. The 4P model has been con-
sidered to be most relevant for consumer marketing. However, it 
has  been  criticized  as  being  a  production-oriented  deﬁnition  of 
marketing,  and  researchers  proposed  a  ﬁfth  P  (people)  [18].  We 
adopt the 5P model of the marketing mix framework in this paper 
because  these  perspectives  play  critical  roles  in  developing  suc-
cessful marketing strategies in the information age.

In this paper, we propose a marketing mix framework to man-
age  big  data  for  marketing  intelligence.  This  model  classiﬁes  the 
research  in  marketing  intelligence  into  ﬁve  perspectives  accord-
ing to the marketing mix framework. Further, we identify common 
data,  methods,  and  applications  in  each  perspective  and  high-
light  the  dominating  big  data  characteristic  with  respect  to  each 
perspective.  This  framework  provides  guidelines  for  marketing 
decision-making based on big data analytics. Fig. 1 is an overview 
of  the  proposed  big  data  management  framework  for  marketing 
intelligence. First, data from various sources are retrieved and uti-
lized to generate vital marketing intelligence. Second, a variety of 
analytics methods are applied to convert raw big data to actionable 
marketing  knowledge  (intelligence).  Finally,  both  data  and  meth-
ods are combined to support marketing applications with respect 
to each perspective of the marketing mix model.

2.1.  Data

Researchers  use  various  methods  to  collect  data,  such  as  sur-
veys, interviews, focus groups, observations, and archives [2]. Note 
that data collection methods are different from research methods. 
For  example,  experiments  are  a  widely  used  research  method  in 
marketing,  but  researchers  rely  on  surveys,  observations,  or  in-
terviews  to  collect  experimental  data  [27].  Surveys  and  logs  are 
the  two  most  common  methods  to  acquire  data  for  business  in-
telligence  [22].  A  survey  is  deﬁned  as  “collecting  information  in 
an  organized  and  methodical  manner  about  characteristics  of  in-

terest  from  some  or  all  units  of  a  population  using  well-deﬁned 
concepts,  methods  and  procedures,  and  compiles  such  informa-
tion into a useful summary form” [10]. Firms use surveys to col-
lect  data  for  various  purposes,  such  as  understanding  customers’ 
preferences  and  behaviors.  For  example,  Apple  has  sent  surveys 
to customers who recently purchased an iPhone to gain feedback 
about their purchase and their experience with the product [16]. 
Log data is generated by information systems that capture trans-
actional records and user behavior [20]. For example, Walmart has 
started  to  explore  analyzing  social  media  data  to  gain  customer 
opinions about the company or a particular product [7]. Log data 
and  survey  data  can  be  different  in  terms  of  size,  quality,  fre-
quency,  objectives,  contents,  and  processing  techniques  [37].  The 
two  data  collection  methods  complement  each  other  in  various 
business contexts. Surveys can be useful when we want to collect 
data on phenomena that cannot be directly observed. Log data are 
preferred when real-time conclusions about users’ actual behavior 
are  required.  The  two  methods  can  be  combined  when  we  want 
to study the relationship between user intention and user behav-
ior. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods, and 
we  believe  big  data  management  should  take  both  methods  into 
consideration.

2.2.  Methods

Marketing  intelligence  refers  to  developing  insights  from  data 
for  marketing  decision-making.  Data  mining  techniques  can  help 
to  accomplish  such  a  goal  by  extracting  or  detecting patterns  or 
forecasting  customer  behavior  from  large databases.  According  to 
the data mining literature, common data mining methods include 
association  mining,  classiﬁcation,  clustering,  and  regression  [31]. 
We need to select appropriate data mining methods based on the 
data characteristics and business problems [25].

2.3.  Applications

2.3.1.  Customer segmentation and customer proﬁling

For  effective  marketing,  it  is  essential  to  identify  a  speciﬁc 
group  of  customers  who  share  similar  preferences  and  respond 
to a speciﬁc marketing signal. Customer segmentation applications 
can  help  identify  different  communities  (segments)  of  customers 
who may share similar interests. Kim et al. [23] proposed cluster-

30

S. Fan et al. / Big Data Research 2 (2015) 28–32

ing customer groups with respect to lifecycle characteristics. Usu-
ally, various clustering and classiﬁcation techniques are applied to 
customer segmentation and user proﬁling. However, customer seg-
mentation  is  becoming  increasingly  challenging  under  a  big  data 
environment. For instance, to differentiate among customer groups 
for telecommunication applications, it is necessary to analyze their 
call  data  apart  from  their  demographics  [1].  The  volume  of  call 
data is huge (e.g., the communication time between each pair of 
customers on each day), and a variety of data should be taken into 
account  (e.g.,  both  qualitative  demographic  data  and  quantitative 
call records). In fact, for the most ﬁne-grained targeted marketing 
(e.g., one-to-one marketing), we are not talking about identifying 
groups of similar customers, but the “proﬁling” of each individual 
customer  such  that  the  most  suitable  products/services  are  mar-
keted to the most appropriate individual given a steam of customer 
service consumption data generated in real-time [1].

2.3.2.  Product ontology and product reputation management

To alleviate the shortcoming of retrieving limited product rep-
utation  via  survey  data,  Morinaga  et  al.  [30] developed  an  auto-
matic framework to monitor the reputation of a variety of products 
by mining Web contents. Clustering and association mining tech-
niques are among the most common methods employed to support 
reputation management applications. More recently, Di et al. [14]
proposed a reputation management method which not only mines 
text-based  reputation  data  from  the  Web  but  also  considers  the 
graphical images of products posted to the Web. Nevertheless, by 
the time of this writing, twenty billion images have been uploaded 
to Instagram.1 Given such an extraordinary size of images archived 
online, it is extremely challenging to analyze the sheer volume of 
images  for  product  reputation  management,  not  to  mention  the 
variety  of  formats  of  source  data  (e.g.,  text  versus  images).  To 
carry  out  an  automatic  analysis  of  the  textual  comments  posted 
to  the  Web  for  product  reputation  management,  it  is  essential 
to  develop  a  rich  computer-based  representation  of  product  in-
formation for subsequent product reputation analysis. Recently, an 
automated  product  ontology  mining  method  that  is  underpinned 
by latent topic modeling has been explored to build product on-
tologies based on textual descriptions of products extracted from 
online  social  media  [24].  The  automatically  constructed  product 
ontologies can be used as the basis to support product reputation 
management  applications  and  other  marketing  intelligence  appli-
cations.  However,  given  the  computational  complexities  involved 
in automated product ontology extraction from online social me-
dia, new computational methods must be developed to cope with 
the volume, velocity, and variety issues of big social media data.

2.3.3.  Promotional marketing analysis and recommender systems

In  the  increasingly  competitive  business  environment,  billions 
of  dollars  are  spent  on  promotions  each  year  [34].  Thus,  promo-
tional marketing analysis has attracted a lot of attention from prac-
titioners and researchers. Effective promotional strategies are one 
of the key success factors for companies to increase their sales and 
revenue  [4].  Promotional  data  usually  includes  information  about 
promotion types (price cut or coupons), promotion time, and pur-
chase  records  during  the  promotional  period.  Early  work  related 
to  promotional  marketing  analysis  mostly  focused  on  analyzing 
how different types of customers respond to different promotional 
strategies or how different categories of products affect the effec-
tiveness  of  promotional  strategies  [33].  Most  existing  work  uses 
regression methods to study promotions in different contexts [4].

In the big data environment, more log data becomes/is available 
for promotion analysis. A recent work studied WOM derived from 

1 http://instagram.com/press/#.

both customer reviews and promotions [26]. The authors found a 
substitute relationship between the WOM volume and coupon of-
ferings, but a complementary relationship between WOM volume 
and keyword advertising. Promotional marketing analysis can also 
include  factors  from  other  perspectives,  such  as  price  and  place. 
For  example,  enabled  by  mobile  technologies  and  location-based 
services, companies can use customers’ location information to im-
prove their promotion strategy and select targeted customers.

To improve product awareness and promote products to poten-
tial  customers,  recommender  systems  have  been  widely  used  in 
the  e-commerce  context  [15].  User  rating-based  collaborative  ﬁl-
tering methods or content-based association mining methods are 
commonly applied to develop recommender systems. However, ex-
isting methods may not scale up to big data. For instance, given N
user ratings, the general computational complexity of a collabora-
tive ﬁltering method is N2 [9]. Therefore, it is quite challenging to 
scale up existing recommender systems to cope with big data (e.g., 
N = tens of millions)  and  generate  appropriate  recommendations 
to  potential  customers  in  real-time  as  expected  in  e-commerce 
settings. This is the reason why “velocity” is one of the most chal-
lenging  issues  for  the  “promotion”  perspective  in  the  context  of 
marketing intelligence.

2.3.4.  Pricing strategy and competitor analysis

There has been much research on what pricing strategies man-
agers should follow under various situations. Traditionally, empir-
ical research on pricing strategies uses survey data and regression 
methods. For example, researchers used a national mail survey to 
study the determinants of pricing strategies [32]. They found dif-
ferent  pricing  strategies  are  preferred  under  different  marketing 
situations.  The  growth  of  e-commerce  has  made  price  informa-
tion  available  on  websites  and  researchers  started  using  log  data 
to study pricing strategy in e-commerce websites. For example, a 
recent study uses a method to estimate demand levels from sales 
rank and derive demand elasticity, variable costs, and the optimal-
ity of pricing choices directly from publicly available e-commerce 
data [17]. Based on the data derived from various log data sources, 
they  can  study  the  optimality  of  price  discrimination.  While  re-
gression methods are widely used for price prediction applications, 
association mining methods are applied to competitor analysis ap-
plications. An automated competitor analysis application does not 
simply  identify  the  potential  competitors  of  a  company;  it  also 
effectively discovers the potentially competitive products and the 
product contexts [3]. This type of application has proven useful to 
facilitate the “price” aspect of the marketing mix model. However, 
the sheer volume of product pricing information on the Web has 
also  posed  new  challenges  to  scale  up  existing  applications  with 
big data.

2.3.5.  Location-based advertising and community dynamic analysis

Place is also an important dimension in marketing analysis. Re-
search on place-based marketing focuses on the impact of places 
on  marketing  strategies.  For  example,  researchers  used  a  survey 
to collect customer data and study different levels of place-based 
marketing in the form of region of origin strategies used by winer-
ies in their branding efforts [8].

With the widespread use of mobile technology, location-based 
services (LBS) can provide users personalized information in a spe-
ciﬁc  location  at  a  speciﬁc  time.  Location-based  advertising  has 
been proposed as an eﬃcient marketing strategy [13,27]. Location 
is one of the most important solutions to meet consumers’ need 
and  it  is  a  valuable  source  for  personalized  marketing  informa-
tion.  In  location-based  advertising,  customers  can  get  timely  ad-
vertisements or product recommendations based on their current 
position  or  predicted  future  position.  Location-based  advertising 
provides a new tool for companies to attract more customers and 

S. Fan et al. / Big Data Research 2 (2015) 28–32

31

enhance brand value. One challenge for location-based advertising 
is how to accurately predict customers’ locations. Both spatial and 
temporal data should be taken into consideration (temporal mov-
ing pattern mining for location-based service). We need to process 
a  large  volume  of  spatial  and  temporal  data  within  a  short  time 
period before customers move to new locations. Thus, the “veloci-
ty” issue of big data is also one of the most challenging aspects for 
location-based advertising.

Researchers explored the log data in location-based social net-
works to uncover user proﬁles; these automatically discovered user 
proﬁles have the potential to be subsequently applied to location-
based targeted marketing [36]. Regression and classiﬁcation meth-
ods are often utilized for location-based marketing applications. In 
another study, Castro et al. [11] leverage the GPS traces of individ-
uals to uncover the location-based dynamics of different commu-
nities. Through analyzing the dynamics of local communities, it is 
possible to predict their changing product/service preferences. As 
a result, effective marketing strategies can be developed with re-
spect to both the place and time dynamics of a group of customers. 
Nevertheless, this type of application needs to deal with both the 
“variety”  and  “velocity”  issues  of  big  data.  For  instance,  both  the 
relational data among users in location-based social networks and 
GPS signals need to be analyzed to uncover the location-based dy-
namics  of  a  local  community.  In  addition,  since  individuals  may 
constantly move around different places, location-based marketing 
applications must be able to respond quickly in order to maintain 
the location sensitivity with respect to the constantly moving cus-
tomers.

3.  Future research directions

We  propose  to  use  a  marketing  mix  framework  for  guiding 
research  in  big  data  management  for  marketing  intelligence.  We 
identify  the  data  sources,  methods,  and  applications  in  different 
marketing perspectives. We further discuss the challenging issues 
related  to  big  data  management  in  the  context  of  various  mar-
keting perspectives. Based on the framework, we highlight future 
research directions in big data management.

1. Study  how  to  select  appropriate  data  sources  for  particular 
goals. The amount of available data is increasing. Current tech-
niques do not allow us to process all data available in a timely 
manner. Thus, data selection is a critical decision for manag-
ing marketing intelligence. How to select data that can provide 
the  most  value  to  business  decision-making  requires  future 
research on the alignment between data and marketing intel-
ligence goals.

2. Analyze  how  to  select  appropriate  data  analysis  methods. 
There  are  many  types  of  methods  that  can  be  used  to  pro-
cess data. Given a particular data set, many methods may be 
applicable.  Regression  and  classiﬁcation  are  usually  used  for 
prediction,  while  clustering  and  association  rule  mining  are 
used  for  description.  Further,  big  data  brings  issues  such  as 
imbalanced  data  distribution  and  large  number  of  variables, 
which  cannot  be  eﬃciently  handled  by  existing  data  mining 
methods.  We  need  to  improve  existing  methods  to  increase 
the eﬃciency and accuracy.

3. Inquire how to integrate different data sources to study com-
plicated  marketing  problems.  Most  existing  studies  use  data 
from one single data source. However, some complicated busi-
ness problems require combining data from different sources. 
For example, in order to study the impact of social media be-
havior on purchase behavior, we may need to combine social 
media data and transaction records.

4. Investigate  how  to  deal  with  the  heterogeneity  among  data 
sources.  For  example,  both  customer  reviews  and  social  me-

dia  data  can  be  used  to  study  customer  opinions  toward  a 
company  or  a  product.  However,  data  collection  and  analysis 
methods  may  be  different  due  to  different  structure,  quality, 
granularity,  and  objective.  Further,  survey  data  and  log  data 
can also be used to study the same marketing problem. How 
to conduct surveys in social media and conﬁrm the survey re-
sult with log data in social media will become an important 
topic in e-commerce research and applications.

5. Examine how to balance investments in marketing intelligence 
techniques.  Big  data-enabled  marketing  intelligence  will  be-
come a competitive source for consumer behavior and product 
planning; therefore all companies must invest in big data in-
frastructure including data scientists and big data platforms.

6. Explicate  how  to  reﬁne  the  framework  as  the  big  data  tech-
nology  evolve  continuously.  Data  of  a  variety  of  formats  and 
qualities will continue to grow and be digitized. Even though 
peta-scale  data  (e.g.,  petabytes  of  customer  records)  may  be 
considered  big  data  now,  the  same  volume  of  data  may  not 
be considered big in a few years. It is important to continu-
ously reﬁne the framework, methods, and techniques that we 
discuss in this paper in order to meet the challenges for more 
advanced  business  intelligence  in  the  next  generation  of  big 
data management.

Big data analytics have been embraced as a disruptive technology that will reshape business intelligence, 
which  is  a  domain  that  relies  on  data  analytics  to  gain  business  insights  for  better  decision-making. 
Rooted in the recent literature, we investigate the landscape of big data analytics through the lens of a 
marketing mix framework in this paper. We identify the data sources, methods, and applications related 
to ﬁve important marketing perspectives, namely people, product, place, price, and promotion, that lay 
the foundation for marketing intelligence. We then discuss several challenging research issues and future 
directions of research in big data analytics and marketing related business intelligence in general.

1.  Introduction

Recent  technological  revolutions  such  as  social  media  enable 
us  to  generate  data  much  faster  than  ever  before  [28].  The  no-
tion  of  big  data  and  its  application  in  business  intelligence  have 
attracted enormous attention in recent years because of its great 
potential in generating business impacts [12]. “Big Data” is deﬁned 
as “the amount of data just beyond technology’s capability to store, 
manage and process eﬃciently” [21]. Big data can be characterized 
along  three  important  dimensions,  namely  volume,  velocity,  and 
variety [38].

In  marketing  intelligence,  which  emphasizes  the  marketing-
related  aspects  of  business  intelligence,  data  relevant  to  a  com-
pany’s  markets  is  collected  and  processed  into  insights  that  sup-
port decision-making [19]. Marketing intelligence has traditionally 
relied  on  market  surveys  to  understand  consumer  behavior  and 
improve  product  design.  For  example,  companies  use  consumer 
satisfaction surveys to study customer attitudes. With big data an-
alytic  technologies,  key  factors  for  strategic  marketing  decisions, 
such as customer opinions toward a product, service, or company, 
can be automatically monitored by mining social media data [35].
However, while accessibility to big data creates unprecedented 
opportunities  for  marketing  intelligence,  it  also  brings  challenges

to practitioners and researchers. Big data analytics is mainly con-
cerned with three types of challenges: storage, management, and 
processing  [21].  For  typical  marketing  intelligence  tasks  such  as 
customer opinion mining, companies nowadays have many differ-
ent ways (social media data, transactional data, survey data, sensor 
network  data,  etc.)  to  collect  data  from  a  variety  of  information 
sources.  Based  on  the  characteristics  of  collected  data,  different 
methods can be applied to discover marketing intelligence. Anal-
ysis  models  developed  based  on  a  single  data  source  may  only 
provide limited insights, leading to potentially biased business de-
cisions. On the other hand, integrating heterogeneous information 
from different sources provides a holistic view of the domain and 
generates more accurate marketing intelligence. Unfortunately, in-
tegrating  big  data  from  multiple  sources  to  generate  marketing 
intelligence is not a trivial task. This prompts exploration of new 
methods, applications, and frameworks for effective big data man-
agement in the context of marketing intelligence.

We investigate different perspectives of marketing intelligence 
and propose a framework to manage big data in this context. We 
ﬁrst identify popular data sources for marketing intelligence per-
spectives. Then, we summarize the methods that are suitable for 
different data sources and marketing perspectives. Finally, we give 
examples  of  applications  in  different  perspectives.  The  proposed 
framework provides guidelines for companies to select appropriate 
data  sources  and  methods  for  managing  vital  marketing  intelli-
gence to meet their strategic goals.

2.  A big data management framework

The marketing mix framework is a well-known framework that 
identiﬁes the principal components of marketing decisions, and it 
has dominated marketing thought, research, and practice [6]. Bor-
den [5] has been recognized as the ﬁrst to use the term “marketing 
mix”  and  he  proposed  a  set  of  12  elements.  McCarthy  [29] re-
grouped  Borden’s  12  elements  to  four  elements  or  4Ps,  namely 
product, price, promotion, and place. The 4P model has been con-
sidered to be most relevant for consumer marketing. However, it 
has  been  criticized  as  being  a  production-oriented  deﬁnition  of 
marketing,  and  researchers  proposed  a  ﬁfth  P  (people)  [18].  We 
adopt the 5P model of the marketing mix framework in this paper 
because  these  perspectives  play  critical  roles  in  developing  suc-
cessful marketing strategies in the information age.

In this paper, we propose a marketing mix framework to man-
age  big  data  for  marketing  intelligence.  This  model  classiﬁes  the 
research  in  marketing  intelligence  into  ﬁve  perspectives  accord-
ing to the marketing mix framework. Further, we identify common 
data,  methods,  and  applications  in  each  perspective  and  high-
light  the  dominating  big  data  characteristic  with  respect  to  each 
perspective.  This  framework  provides  guidelines  for  marketing 
decision-making based on big data analytics. Fig. 1 is an overview 
of  the  proposed  big  data  management  framework  for  marketing 
intelligence. First, data from various sources are retrieved and uti-
lized to generate vital marketing intelligence. Second, a variety of 
analytics methods are applied to convert raw big data to actionable 
marketing  knowledge  (intelligence).  Finally,  both  data  and  meth-
ods are combined to support marketing applications with respect 
to each perspective of the marketing mix model.

2.1.  Data

Researchers  use  various  methods  to  collect  data,  such  as  sur-
veys, interviews, focus groups, observations, and archives [2]. Note 
that data collection methods are different from research methods. 
For  example,  experiments  are  a  widely  used  research  method  in 
marketing,  but  researchers  rely  on  surveys,  observations,  or  in-
terviews  to  collect  experimental  data  [27].  Surveys  and  logs  are 
the  two  most  common  methods  to  acquire  data  for  business  in-
telligence  [22].  A  survey  is  deﬁned  as  “collecting  information  in 
an  organized  and  methodical  manner  about  characteristics  of  in-

terest  from  some  or  all  units  of  a  population  using  well-deﬁned 
concepts,  methods  and  procedures,  and  compiles  such  informa-
tion into a useful summary form” [10]. Firms use surveys to col-
lect  data  for  various  purposes,  such  as  understanding  customers’ 
preferences  and  behaviors.  For  example,  Apple  has  sent  surveys 
to customers who recently purchased an iPhone to gain feedback 
about their purchase and their experience with the product [16]. 
Log data is generated by information systems that capture trans-
actional records and user behavior [20]. For example, Walmart has 
started  to  explore  analyzing  social  media  data  to  gain  customer 
opinions about the company or a particular product [7]. Log data 
and  survey  data  can  be  different  in  terms  of  size,  quality,  fre-
quency,  objectives,  contents,  and  processing  techniques  [37].  The 
two  data  collection  methods  complement  each  other  in  various 
business contexts. Surveys can be useful when we want to collect 
data on phenomena that cannot be directly observed. Log data are 
preferred when real-time conclusions about users’ actual behavior 
are  required.  The  two  methods  can  be  combined  when  we  want 
to study the relationship between user intention and user behav-
ior. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods, and 
we  believe  big  data  management  should  take  both  methods  into 
consideration.

2.2.  Methods

Marketing  intelligence  refers  to  developing  insights  from  data 
for  marketing  decision-making.  Data  mining  techniques  can  help 
to  accomplish  such  a  goal  by  extracting  or  detecting patterns  or 
forecasting  customer  behavior  from  large databases.  According  to 
the data mining literature, common data mining methods include 
association  mining,  classiﬁcation,  clustering,  and  regression  [31]. 
We need to select appropriate data mining methods based on the 
data characteristics and business problems [25].

2.3.  Applications

2.3.1.  Customer segmentation and customer proﬁling

For  effective  marketing,  it  is  essential  to  identify  a  speciﬁc 
group  of  customers  who  share  similar  preferences  and  respond 
to a speciﬁc marketing signal. Customer segmentation applications 
can  help  identify  different  communities  (segments)  of  customers 
who may share similar interests. Kim et al. [23] proposed cluster-

30

S. Fan et al. / Big Data Research 2 (2015) 28–32

ing customer groups with respect to lifecycle characteristics. Usu-
ally, various clustering and classiﬁcation techniques are applied to 
customer segmentation and user proﬁling. However, customer seg-
mentation  is  becoming  increasingly  challenging  under  a  big  data 
environment. For instance, to differentiate among customer groups 
for telecommunication applications, it is necessary to analyze their 
call  data  apart  from  their  demographics  [1].  The  volume  of  call 
data is huge (e.g., the communication time between each pair of 
customers on each day), and a variety of data should be taken into 
account  (e.g.,  both  qualitative  demographic  data  and  quantitative 
call records). In fact, for the most ﬁne-grained targeted marketing 
(e.g., one-to-one marketing), we are not talking about identifying 
groups of similar customers, but the “proﬁling” of each individual 
customer  such  that  the  most  suitable  products/services  are  mar-
keted to the most appropriate individual given a steam of customer 
service consumption data generated in real-time [1].

2.3.2.  Product ontology and product reputation management

To alleviate the shortcoming of retrieving limited product rep-
utation  via  survey  data,  Morinaga  et  al.  [30] developed  an  auto-
matic framework to monitor the reputation of a variety of products 
by mining Web contents. Clustering and association mining tech-
niques are among the most common methods employed to support 
reputation management applications. More recently, Di et al. [14]
proposed a reputation management method which not only mines 
text-based  reputation  data  from  the  Web  but  also  considers  the 
graphical images of products posted to the Web. Nevertheless, by 
the time of this writing, twenty billion images have been uploaded 
to Instagram.1 Given such an extraordinary size of images archived 
online, it is extremely challenging to analyze the sheer volume of 
images  for  product  reputation  management,  not  to  mention  the 
variety  of  formats  of  source  data  (e.g.,  text  versus  images).  To 
carry  out  an  automatic  analysis  of  the  textual  comments  posted 
to  the  Web  for  product  reputation  management,  it  is  essential 
to  develop  a  rich  computer-based  representation  of  product  in-
formation for subsequent product reputation analysis. Recently, an 
automated  product  ontology  mining  method  that  is  underpinned 
by latent topic modeling has been explored to build product on-
tologies based on textual descriptions of products extracted from 
online  social  media  [24].  The  automatically  constructed  product 
ontologies can be used as the basis to support product reputation 
management  applications  and  other  marketing  intelligence  appli-
cations.  However,  given  the  computational  complexities  involved 
in automated product ontology extraction from online social me-
dia, new computational methods must be developed to cope with 
the volume, velocity, and variety issues of big social media data.

2.3.3.  Promotional marketing analysis and recommender systems

In  the  increasingly  competitive  business  environment,  billions 
of  dollars  are  spent  on  promotions  each  year  [34].  Thus,  promo-
tional marketing analysis has attracted a lot of attention from prac-
titioners and researchers. Effective promotional strategies are one 
of the key success factors for companies to increase their sales and 
revenue  [4].  Promotional  data  usually  includes  information  about 
promotion types (price cut or coupons), promotion time, and pur-
chase  records  during  the  promotional  period.  Early  work  related 
to  promotional  marketing  analysis  mostly  focused  on  analyzing 
how different types of customers respond to different promotional 
strategies or how different categories of products affect the effec-
tiveness  of  promotional  strategies  [33].  Most  existing  work  uses 
regression methods to study promotions in different contexts [4].

In the big data environment, more log data becomes/is available 
for promotion analysis. A recent work studied WOM derived from 

1 http://instagram.com/press/#.

both customer reviews and promotions [26]. The authors found a 
substitute relationship between the WOM volume and coupon of-
ferings, but a complementary relationship between WOM volume 
and keyword advertising. Promotional marketing analysis can also 
include  factors  from  other  perspectives,  such  as  price  and  place. 
For  example,  enabled  by  mobile  technologies  and  location-based 
services, companies can use customers’ location information to im-
prove their promotion strategy and select targeted customers.

To improve product awareness and promote products to poten-
tial  customers,  recommender  systems  have  been  widely  used  in 
the  e-commerce  context  [15].  User  rating-based  collaborative  ﬁl-
tering methods or content-based association mining methods are 
commonly applied to develop recommender systems. However, ex-
isting methods may not scale up to big data. For instance, given N
user ratings, the general computational complexity of a collabora-
tive ﬁltering method is N2 [9]. Therefore, it is quite challenging to 
scale up existing recommender systems to cope with big data (e.g., 
N = tens of millions)  and  generate  appropriate  recommendations 
to  potential  customers  in  real-time  as  expected  in  e-commerce 
settings. This is the reason why “velocity” is one of the most chal-
lenging  issues  for  the  “promotion”  perspective  in  the  context  of 
marketing intelligence.

2.3.4.  Pricing strategy and competitor analysis

There has been much research on what pricing strategies man-
agers should follow under various situations. Traditionally, empir-
ical research on pricing strategies uses survey data and regression 
methods. For example, researchers used a national mail survey to 
study the determinants of pricing strategies [32]. They found dif-
ferent  pricing  strategies  are  preferred  under  different  marketing 
situations.  The  growth  of  e-commerce  has  made  price  informa-
tion  available  on  websites  and  researchers  started  using  log  data 
to study pricing strategy in e-commerce websites. For example, a 
recent study uses a method to estimate demand levels from sales 
rank and derive demand elasticity, variable costs, and the optimal-
ity of pricing choices directly from publicly available e-commerce 
data [17]. Based on the data derived from various log data sources, 
they  can  study  the  optimality  of  price  discrimination.  While  re-
gression methods are widely used for price prediction applications, 
association mining methods are applied to competitor analysis ap-
plications. An automated competitor analysis application does not 
simply  identify  the  potential  competitors  of  a  company;  it  also 
effectively discovers the potentially competitive products and the 
product contexts [3]. This type of application has proven useful to 
facilitate the “price” aspect of the marketing mix model. However, 
the sheer volume of product pricing information on the Web has 
also  posed  new  challenges  to  scale  up  existing  applications  with 
big data.

2.3.5.  Location-based advertising and community dynamic analysis

Place is also an important dimension in marketing analysis. Re-
search on place-based marketing focuses on the impact of places 
on  marketing  strategies.  For  example,  researchers  used  a  survey 
to collect customer data and study different levels of place-based 
marketing in the form of region of origin strategies used by winer-
ies in their branding efforts [8].

With the widespread use of mobile technology, location-based 
services (LBS) can provide users personalized information in a spe-
ciﬁc  location  at  a  speciﬁc  time.  Location-based  advertising  has 
been proposed as an eﬃcient marketing strategy [13,27]. Location 
is one of the most important solutions to meet consumers’ need 
and  it  is  a  valuable  source  for  personalized  marketing  informa-
tion.  In  location-based  advertising,  customers  can  get  timely  ad-
vertisements or product recommendations based on their current 
position  or  predicted  future  position.  Location-based  advertising 
provides a new tool for companies to attract more customers and 

S. Fan et al. / Big Data Research 2 (2015) 28–32

31

enhance brand value. One challenge for location-based advertising 
is how to accurately predict customers’ locations. Both spatial and 
temporal data should be taken into consideration (temporal mov-
ing pattern mining for location-based service). We need to process 
a  large  volume  of  spatial  and  temporal  data  within  a  short  time 
period before customers move to new locations. Thus, the “veloci-
ty” issue of big data is also one of the most challenging aspects for 
location-based advertising.

Researchers explored the log data in location-based social net-
works to uncover user proﬁles; these automatically discovered user 
proﬁles have the potential to be subsequently applied to location-
based targeted marketing [36]. Regression and classiﬁcation meth-
ods are often utilized for location-based marketing applications. In 
another study, Castro et al. [11] leverage the GPS traces of individ-
uals to uncover the location-based dynamics of different commu-
nities. Through analyzing the dynamics of local communities, it is 
possible to predict their changing product/service preferences. As 
a result, effective marketing strategies can be developed with re-
spect to both the place and time dynamics of a group of customers. 
Nevertheless, this type of application needs to deal with both the 
“variety”  and  “velocity”  issues  of  big  data.  For  instance,  both  the 
relational data among users in location-based social networks and 
GPS signals need to be analyzed to uncover the location-based dy-
namics  of  a  local  community.  In  addition,  since  individuals  may 
constantly move around different places, location-based marketing 
applications must be able to respond quickly in order to maintain 
the location sensitivity with respect to the constantly moving cus-
tomers.

3.  Future research directions

We  propose  to  use  a  marketing  mix  framework  for  guiding 
research  in  big  data  management  for  marketing  intelligence.  We 
identify  the  data  sources,  methods,  and  applications  in  different 
marketing perspectives. We further discuss the challenging issues 
related  to  big  data  management  in  the  context  of  various  mar-
keting perspectives. Based on the framework, we highlight future 
research directions in big data management.

1. Study  how  to  select  appropriate  data  sources  for  particular 
goals. The amount of available data is increasing. Current tech-
niques do not allow us to process all data available in a timely 
manner. Thus, data selection is a critical decision for manag-
ing marketing intelligence. How to select data that can provide 
the  most  value  to  business  decision-making  requires  future 
research on the alignment between data and marketing intel-
ligence goals.

2. Analyze  how  to  select  appropriate  data  analysis  methods. 
There  are  many  types  of  methods  that  can  be  used  to  pro-
cess data. Given a particular data set, many methods may be 
applicable.  Regression  and  classiﬁcation  are  usually  used  for 
prediction,  while  clustering  and  association  rule  mining  are 
used  for  description.  Further,  big  data  brings  issues  such  as 
imbalanced  data  distribution  and  large  number  of  variables, 
which  cannot  be  eﬃciently  handled  by  existing  data  mining 
methods.  We  need  to  improve  existing  methods  to  increase 
the eﬃciency and accuracy.

3. Inquire how to integrate different data sources to study com-
plicated  marketing  problems.  Most  existing  studies  use  data 
from one single data source. However, some complicated busi-
ness problems require combining data from different sources. 
For example, in order to study the impact of social media be-
havior on purchase behavior, we may need to combine social 
media data and transaction records.

4. Investigate  how  to  deal  with  the  heterogeneity  among  data 
sources.  For  example,  both  customer  reviews  and  social  me-

dia  data  can  be  used  to  study  customer  opinions  toward  a 
company  or  a  product.  However,  data  collection  and  analysis 
methods  may  be  different  due  to  different  structure,  quality, 
granularity,  and  objective.  Further,  survey  data  and  log  data 
can also be used to study the same marketing problem. How 
to conduct surveys in social media and conﬁrm the survey re-
sult with log data in social media will become an important 
topic in e-commerce research and applications.

5. Examine how to balance investments in marketing intelligence 
techniques.  Big  data-enabled  marketing  intelligence  will  be-
come a competitive source for consumer behavior and product 
planning; therefore all companies must invest in big data in-
frastructure including data scientists and big data platforms.

6. Explicate  how  to  reﬁne  the  framework  as  the  big  data  tech-
nology  evolve  continuously.  Data  of  a  variety  of  formats  and 
qualities will continue to grow and be digitized. Even though 
peta-scale  data  (e.g.,  petabytes  of  customer  records)  may  be 
considered  big  data  now,  the  same  volume  of  data  may  not 
be considered big in a few years. It is important to continu-
ously reﬁne the framework, methods, and techniques that we 
discuss in this paper in order to meet the challenges for more 
advanced  business  intelligence  in  the  next  generation  of  big 
data management.
