remains a randomised clinical 
trial (RCT).  The RCT is an 
excellent method to compare 
therapeutic variables but may 
not reflect a ‘standard’ hospital’s 
practice.  The generalisability of 
RCT studies to physicians and 
hospitals not part of the original 
trials are well documented;2 
and extrapolation of ‘outcomes’ 
is problematic.  Outcomes 
research is a methodological 
technique that analyses all 
patients (usually from large 
specific databases) and reflects 
population heterogeneity.  It 
also assesses the ‘provider’ 
and considers variables such as 
volume number, teaching status 
and subspecialisation.  Dataset 
analysis involves large numbers 
of patients which permit 
powered subset confounder 
analysis, however it still requires 
hypotheses, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, outcomes/
endpoints, comparison groups 
and covariates.  It is not data 
mining but is a robust analytical 
process.  This method of 
research therefore still analyses 
outcomes but the emphasis is at 
physician, hospital, national and 
international level.
 
Publication of outcomes 
research using national 
datasets is increasing, and 
there are numerous examples 
of international orthopaedic 
publications from the Australian 
Orthopaedic Association NJR 
Registry3, The Danish National 

Registry4, and the Norwegian 
and Swedish Arthroplasty 
registries.  In the UK, the seminal 
paper by Smith et al reported 
the outcomes of metal on metal 
arthroplasty and its inherent 
issues5.  To date, there are 
twenty five publications listed 
on the UK’s NJR website linked 
to research using the NJR data 
set.  However, there remain 
challenges.  It seems apparent 
following discussion at the recent 
British Hip Society AGM that 
currently the NJR may not be 
a valid tool to analyse data at 
individual surgeon level and there 
was much debate concerning the 
data for reporting outcomes at 
unit level.  NJR aside, whatever 
‘level’ of analysis the datasets 
are used for, questions about 
the validity of their use remains.  
For example, in a recent paper, 
Sabah et al conclude that 
the NJR underestimates the 
revision rate for metal on metal 
hip replacements6.  Ongoing 
validation programmes to 
improve the data, hopefully 
negating these questions in the 
future, are in place for all clinical 
registries. 

An additional approach to 
outcomes research is to use 
administrative data.  One 
criticism levelled at administrative 
datasets is that the data is not 
collected by clinicians but by 
coders with limited understanding 
of the complexities of medical 
care.  However, there is 

robust training for coding staff 
internationally and inaccuracies 
which may occur tend to be 
random and therefore unlikely 
to bias findings.  Administrative 
databases are not meant to 
replace clinical data registries but 
they may complement each other.  
Chang et al have used the analogy 
of screening and diagnostic 
tests when analysing outcomes 
from administrative datasets and 
clinical databases7.  Outcomes 
generated from analysis of 
administrative data which are 
sensitive but not necessarily 
specific should not be dismissed 
but should instead be followed 
up, potentially by analysis of the 
clinical databases.  The sheer 
volume of useful data contained 
within the administrative dataset, 
in some ways greater than that 
stored in clinical databases, and 
certainly far greater than that of 
RCTs, make it wrong to dismiss 
the findings of administrative 
dataset outcomes research.  In the 
UK, HES data has been analysed 
and publications produced in the 
areas of mortality after fractured 
neck of femur, outcome after total 
hip replacement and the incidence 
of pulmonary embolus after joint 
replacements8-10. 

The recently published GIRFT 
report11 states, “With a projected 
NHS savings requirement of 
£20 billion by 2015, against 
a background of an ageing 
population with an increasing 
requirement for orthopaedic 

treatment, there must be an 
attempt to address provision of 
care which accounts for 80% of 
the total cost”.  We in the UK are 
not alone in this predicament.  
Health service provision 
worldwide is under severe strain.  
The Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development 
2014 report states that health 
spending across OECD countries 
is a mean of 9.3% of GDP and 
is rising.  However, there are 
vast differences.  For example, 
in the USA, healthcare accounts 
for 16.9% whereas for the UK 
and Australia it is 9.3% and 
9.1% respectively.  Are the 
clinical outcomes different in 
each country?  Are we treating 
vastly different populations?  Are 
we getting value for money?

foreword to the GIRFT report.  
Currently there are six Global 
Comparators (GC) groups; 
including Gastrointestinal (GI) 
surgery, Health Economics 
and Orthopaedics.  Global 
Comparators started with 31 
organisations in five countries 
which have grown to 45 
organisations in ten countries.  
Each hospital within GC provides 
HES type administrative 
datasets which are analysed 
and validated at Imperial 
College, London.  The initial 
international dataset contained 
6.7 million anonymised inpatient 
records and currently has 20m 
anonymised inpatient records.  
There remain considerable 
challenges when combining 
administrative databases, 
nevertheless it is possible to 
define in-patient admissions, 
diagnostic and procedure groups 
as well as adjust for co-morbidity 
and produce risk adjustment 
models12.

Currently in The Orthopaedic 
GC group we are comparing 
international outcomes following 
fractured neck of femur and the 
effectiveness of revision surgery 
for prosthetic joint infection 
in both hip and knees.  The 
numbers of patients analysed 
in this research is over 55,000 
and administrative data is 
available from four countries.  
We are currently validating our 
comorbidity score modelling 
before statistically analysing the 

international outcomes data.  
However, we do hope to have 
manuscripts for publication 
within the next month and look 
forward to peer review.

As for the future, by measuring 
comparative outcome data, be 
that at national or international 
level it is possible to provide 
meaningful analyses of 
therapeutic intervention 
incorporating provider and 
patient variables.  Outcomes 
research may then be in a 
position to accurately permit 
analysis of cost benefits (net 
costs), cost effectiveness (net 
cost per net change in years 
of life) and perhaps most 
importantly in orthopaedics; 
cost utility analysis, the net 
cost per net change in quality 
of life.  Performing this at 
an international level, with 
the support of clinicians and 
healthcare providers may 
generate meaningful hypotheses 
as to how to deliver excellent 
patient outcomes and address 
realistic provision of care in 
increasingly austere times.

not possible.  However, recent 
collaboration between countries 
has been attempted. 

Dr Foster Global Comparators 
started in 2010 with the aim 
to bring together data from 
hospitals in different countries, 
translate the data into a common 
language, commence research 
and compare the results openly.  
This is only possible however 
when clinicians and healthcare 
providers share their knowledge 
and understanding in order to 
improve patient outcomes; a goal 
championed by Lord Darzi in the

There remain considerable challenges 
when combining adminisTraTive daTabases, 
neverTheless iT is possible To define in-paTienT 
admissions, diagnosTic and procedure groups 
as well as adjusT for co-morbidiTy and 
produce risk adjusTmenT models.

Andy Gordon is a revision hip and 
knee surgeon at Sheffield NHS 
Teaching Hospitals Foundation 
Trust. He obtained his PhD in 
immunobiology and the genetic 
risk factors for aseptic loosening 
after total hip replacement. He 
is currently Vice Chair of the 
Dr Foster Orthopaedic Global 
Comparators Group.

foreword to the GIRFT report.  
Currently there are six Global 
Comparators (GC) groups; 
including Gastrointestinal (GI) 
surgery, Health Economics 
and Orthopaedics.  Global 
Comparators started with 31 
organisations in five countries 
which have grown to 45 
organisations in ten countries.  
Each hospital within GC provides 
HES type administrative 
datasets which are analysed 
and validated at Imperial 
College, London.  The initial 
international dataset contained 
6.7 million anonymised inpatient 
records and currently has 20m 
anonymised inpatient records.  
There remain considerable 
challenges when combining 
administrative databases, 
nevertheless it is possible to 
define in-patient admissions, 
diagnostic and procedure groups 
as well as adjust for co-morbidity 
and produce risk adjustment 
models12.

Currently in The Orthopaedic 
GC group we are comparing 
international outcomes following 
fractured neck of femur and the 
effectiveness of revision surgery 
for prosthetic joint infection 
in both hip and knees.  The 
numbers of patients analysed 
in this research is over 55,000 
and administrative data is 
available from four countries.  
We are currently validating our 
comorbidity score modelling 
before statistically analysing the 

international outcomes data.  
However, we do hope to have 
manuscripts for publication 
within the next month and look 
forward to peer review.

As for the future, by measuring 
comparative outcome data, be 
that at national or international 
level it is possible to provide 
meaningful analyses of 
therapeutic intervention 
incorporating provider and 
patient variables.  Outcomes 
research may then be in a 
position to accurately permit 
analysis of cost benefits (net 
costs), cost effectiveness (net 
cost per net change in years 
of life) and perhaps most 
importantly in orthopaedics; 
cost utility analysis, the net 
cost per net change in quality 
of life.  Performing this at 
an international level, with 
the support of clinicians and 
healthcare providers may 
generate meaningful hypotheses 
as to how to deliver excellent 
patient outcomes and address 
realistic provision of care in 
increasingly austere times.
