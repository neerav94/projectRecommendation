Mapping European Literatures in the 21st Century

Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  research  is,  firstly,  to  map  the  48  national  literatures  of  Europe,  through  the 
exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  contained  in  the  main  literary  database,  the 
Modern  Language Association International Bibliography.  Secondly, the series  obtained are correlated  to 
economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and 
social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands  at the crossroad 
of  several  concepts:  the  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge  domain 
analysis (Hjørland& Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 
1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; 
Boyd  &  Crawford  2012;  Mayer-Schönberger&  Cukier  2013).  Methodologically,  aiming  at  quantitatively 
identifying the  European  national literatures, we base  our research  on  scientometrics.  Initially developed 
by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological 
activity.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and  features  of  the  Modern 
Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 
1980,  2005;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995)  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  number  of  bibliographic  references 
dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize 
the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators.

Digital humanities and big data 

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of 
digital humanities: 

the  ability  to  read  the  archive  of  core  texts,  together  with  their  residual 
materiality from previous media contexts in order to produce intensive modes of 
engagement  with  particular  documents,  groups  of  texts,  and  the  archive  is 
brought to broader audiences. (Dalbello, 2011, p. 497) 

The  following  year,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012),  define  Big  Data  «as  a  cultural, 
technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology […], 
analysis  […],  mythology»  (Boyd  &  Crawford,  2012,  p.  663).  The  technological  aspect 
corresponds to the capacity of extracting, storing, and putting in relation immense sets 
of  information.  Analytically,  these  massive  amounts  of  information  make  it  possible  to 
identify  patterns  that  allow  us  to  obtain  economic,  social,  and  technical  conclusions 
about the behaviour of the series. The authors consider that the belief that big datasets 
represent superior knowledge capable of yielding truthful, objective, and exact results is 
only a mythology.

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of

In 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger (2013) establish that the phenomenon of 
massive  information  implies  a  change  in  the  way  we  consider  data.  Firstly,  we  can  no 
longer  consider  a  sample  of  data,  since  huge  amounts  of  data  are  available.  However, 
this  considerable  amount  of  information  implies  a  certain  uncleanness  of  information. 
Thus, this change means, secondly, that we have to accept the existence of some inexact 
data, an amount that is meaningless given the quantity of information available. Finally, 
frequently,  this  data  does  not  allow  us  to  know  the  causes  of  the  phenomena 
considered, allowing us only to correlate the series. Thus, there is a displacement from 
the determination of the causes of the events observed to their descriptions: instead of 
explaining the past, the correlations are used to predict the future. Moreover, as Berman 
(2013) points out: «Big Data provides quantitative methods to describe relationships, but 
these  descriptions  must  be  transformed  into  experimentally  verified  explanations»  (p. 
226). In this analysis, we will base our explanation on Bourdieu’s study of the behaviour 
of the literary field (1992). 

Once  the  definitions  of  digital  humanities  and  big  data  established,  we  should 
examine if there is a relation between these concepts. Thus, we have extracted from the 
ISI Web of Knowledge the references that correspond to these concepts. 

Figure 1 represents both series obtained from ISI Web of Knowledge by using the 
keyword technique (Callon &Penan, 1983) with the expressions “digital humanities” and 
“big data” in the title, for all disciplines. We observe that both series begin in the 2000s, 
with  the  exception  of  one  publication  about  big  data  published  in  1974.  However,  the 
publications about big data show a very significant growth since 2012.

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller.

Figure 1. Digital Humanities and Big Data - All Disciplines 

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller. 

3  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data 
correspond to business economics (25%) and to library sciences(21%). Finally, there is only 
one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research 
projects that belong, to a certain extent, to both of the abovementioned tendencies. As 
a matter of fact, on the one hand, our research makes use of computing in order to study 
the  behaviour  of  social  sciences,  humanities,  and  arts  issues, particularly, literature.  On 
the other hand, they  are  based on the extraction and analysis of vast amounts  of data. 
Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data,

Mapping European Literatures in the 21st Century

Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  research  is,  firstly,  to  map  the  48  national  literatures  of  Europe,  through  the 
exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  contained  in  the  main  literary  database,  the 
Modern  Language Association International Bibliography.  Secondly, the series  obtained are correlated  to 
economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and 
social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands  at the crossroad 
of  several  concepts:  the  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge  domain 
analysis (Hjørland& Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 
1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; 
Boyd  &  Crawford  2012;  Mayer-Schönberger&  Cukier  2013).  Methodologically,  aiming  at  quantitatively 
identifying the  European  national literatures, we base  our research  on  scientometrics.  Initially developed 
by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological 
activity.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and  features  of  the  Modern 
Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 
1980,  2005;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995)  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  number  of  bibliographic  references 
dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize 
the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators.

Digital humanities and big data 

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of 
digital humanities: 

the  ability  to  read  the  archive  of  core  texts,  together  with  their  residual 
materiality from previous media contexts in order to produce intensive modes of 
engagement  with  particular  documents,  groups  of  texts,  and  the  archive  is 
brought to broader audiences. (Dalbello, 2011, p. 497) 

The  following  year,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012),  define  Big  Data  «as  a  cultural, 
technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology […], 
analysis  […],  mythology»  (Boyd  &  Crawford,  2012,  p.  663).  The  technological  aspect 
corresponds to the capacity of extracting, storing, and putting in relation immense sets 
of  information.  Analytically,  these  massive  amounts  of  information  make  it  possible  to 
identify  patterns  that  allow  us  to  obtain  economic,  social,  and  technical  conclusions 
about the behaviour of the series. The authors consider that the belief that big datasets 
represent superior knowledge capable of yielding truthful, objective, and exact results is 
only a mythology.

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

In 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger (2013) establish that the phenomenon of 
massive  information  implies  a  change  in  the  way  we  consider  data.  Firstly,  we  can  no 
longer  consider  a  sample  of  data,  since  huge  amounts  of  data  are  available.  However, 
this  considerable  amount  of  information  implies  a  certain  uncleanness  of  information. 
Thus, this change means, secondly, that we have to accept the existence of some inexact 
data, an amount that is meaningless given the quantity of information available. Finally, 
frequently,  this  data  does  not  allow  us  to  know  the  causes  of  the  phenomena 
considered, allowing us only to correlate the series. Thus, there is a displacement from 
the determination of the causes of the events observed to their descriptions: instead of 
explaining the past, the correlations are used to predict the future. Moreover, as Berman 
(2013) points out: «Big Data provides quantitative methods to describe relationships, but 
these  descriptions  must  be  transformed  into  experimentally  verified  explanations»  (p. 
226). In this analysis, we will base our explanation on Bourdieu’s study of the behaviour 
of the literary field (1992). 

Once  the  definitions  of  digital  humanities  and  big  data  established,  we  should 
examine if there is a relation between these concepts. Thus, we have extracted from the 
ISI Web of Knowledge the references that correspond to these concepts. 

Figure 1 represents both series obtained from ISI Web of Knowledge by using the 
keyword technique (Callon &Penan, 1983) with the expressions “digital humanities” and 
“big data” in the title, for all disciplines. We observe that both series begin in the 2000s, 
with  the  exception  of  one  publication  about  big  data  published  in  1974.  However,  the 
publications about big data show a very significant growth since 2012.

Figure 1. Digital Humanities and Big Data - All Disciplines 

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller. 

3  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data 
correspond to business economics (25%) and to library sciences(21%). Finally, there is only 
one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research 
projects that belong, to a certain extent, to both of the abovementioned tendencies. As 
a matter of fact, on the one hand, our research makes use of computing in order to study 
the  behaviour  of  social  sciences,  humanities,  and  arts  issues, particularly, literature.  On 
the other hand, they  are  based on the extraction and analysis of vast amounts  of data. 
Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data, 

 

4 

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

a  strange  approach  in  literary  studies.  Moretti focuses  on  the  analysis  of  novels,  plots, 
titles, whereas, we study the critical bibliography about literary works, in order to analyze 
the field. 

Again, we meet Moretti’s aim at studying Europe. As he establishes: 

Where  does  the  European  novel  begin?  Who  knows,  who  cares?  But  when  it 
managed to survive and to grow, this is relevant, and this we know: in Europe. In 
the  European  archipelago:  a  space  discontinuous  enough  to  allow  the 
simultaneous exploration of widely different paths. (p. 18) 

Once more, we differ from him, since, in this paper, our purpose is to map the 48 
national 
literatures  of  Europe,  through  the  exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the 
bibliographic references contained in the main literary database, the Modern  Language 
Association International Bibliography, from now on MLAIB.Then, the series obtained are 
correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and 
how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. Thus, we believe 
that our methods and aims fairly complement Moretti’s. 

 

Theory and methodology 

From the theoretical viewpoint, this  project stands at the crossroad of several  notions: 
the  concept  of  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge 
domain  analysis  (Albrechtsen  1997;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995;  Hjorland  2001; 
Nascimento  &  Marteleto  2008),  scientometrics  (Price  1963;  Garfield  1980,  2005; 
Leydesdorff  1998),  and  big  data  (Boyd  & Crawford  2012;  Cukier  &  Mayer-Schoenberger 
2013; Mayer-Schönberger& Cukier 2013). 

According  to  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  society  can  be  defined  as  the 
intertwining  of fields: economic, political, religious, cultural, etc. Each field is organized 
according to its own logic that corresponds to the issues that characterize it. Thus, within 
a field, the interactions between the agents are structured according to their resources: 
economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital. 

In  their  research  about  the  disciplinary  field  of  architecture,  Nascimento  and 
Marteleto  (2008)  reinforced  the  relations  between  the  concept  of  knowledge  domain 
analysis  –developed  by  Hjørland  and  Albrechtsen  (1995),  Albrechtsen  (1997),  and 
Hjørland (2001)– and Bourdieu’s field concept. Particularly, the authors state that: 

it becomes possible to understand how and why informational practice (as social 
practice)  is  constituted  within  a  domain  of  knowledge,  and,  above  all,  interpret 
the  historical,  cultural,  and  social  dimensions  that  influence  the  construction  of 
information. (Nascimento & Marteleto, 2008, p. 402) 

Methodologically,  aiming  at  identifying  the  European  national  literatures  in 
quantitative terms, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price 
(1963),  the  purpose  of  scientometrics  is  to  measure  and  to  analyze  the  scientific  and 
technological  activity.  Its  development  is  due  to  the  foundation  of  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  by  Eugene  Garfield,  nowadays 
internationally  renowned  as 
Thomson  ISI.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and 
features of the abovementioned MLAIB. This electronic bibliography, the most important

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller.

the 21st Century 

 

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data

one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research

Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data,

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

a  strange  approach  in  literary  studies.  Moretti focuses  on  the  analysis  of  novels,  plots, 
titles, whereas, we study the critical bibliography about literary works, in order to analyze 
the field. 

Again, we meet Moretti’s aim at studying Europe. As he establishes: 

Where  does  the  European  novel  begin?  Who  knows,  who  cares?  But  when  it 
managed to survive and to grow, this is relevant, and this we know: in Europe. In 
the  European  archipelago:  a  space  discontinuous  enough  to  allow  the 
simultaneous exploration of widely different paths. (p. 18) 

Once more, we differ from him, since, in this paper, our purpose is to map the 48 
national 
literatures  of  Europe,  through  the  exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the 
bibliographic references contained in the main literary database, the Modern  Language 
Association International Bibliography, from now on MLAIB.Then, the series obtained are 
correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and 
how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. Thus, we believe 
that our methods and aims fairly complement Moretti’s. 

 

Theory and methodology 

From the theoretical viewpoint, this  project stands at the crossroad of several  notions: 
the  concept  of  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge 
domain  analysis  (Albrechtsen  1997;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995;  Hjorland  2001; 
Nascimento  &  Marteleto  2008),  scientometrics  (Price  1963;  Garfield  1980,  2005; 
Leydesdorff  1998),  and  big  data  (Boyd  & Crawford  2012;  Cukier  &  Mayer-Schoenberger 
2013; Mayer-Schönberger& Cukier 2013). 

According  to  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  society  can  be  defined  as  the 
intertwining  of fields: economic, political, religious, cultural, etc. Each field is organized 
according to its own logic that corresponds to the issues that characterize it. Thus, within 
a field, the interactions between the agents are structured according to their resources: 
economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital. 

In  their  research  about  the  disciplinary  field  of  architecture,  Nascimento  and 
Marteleto  (2008)  reinforced  the  relations  between  the  concept  of  knowledge  domain 
analysis  –developed  by  Hjørland  and  Albrechtsen  (1995),  Albrechtsen  (1997),  and 
Hjørland (2001)– and Bourdieu’s field concept. Particularly, the authors state that: 

it becomes possible to understand how and why informational practice (as social 
practice)  is  constituted  within  a  domain  of  knowledge,  and,  above  all,  interpret 
the  historical,  cultural,  and  social  dimensions  that  influence  the  construction  of 
information. (Nascimento & Marteleto, 2008, p. 402) 

Methodologically,  aiming  at  identifying  the  European  national  literatures  in 
quantitative terms, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price 
(1963),  the  purpose  of  scientometrics  is  to  measure  and  to  analyze  the  scientific  and 
technological  activity.  Its  development  is  due  to  the  foundation  of  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  by  Eugene  Garfield,  nowadays 
internationally  renowned  as 
Thomson  ISI.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and 
features of the abovementioned MLAIB. This electronic bibliography, the most important 

5  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 
one  in  literary  studies,  contains  over  2,200,000  references  and  includes  approximately 
4,400  journals.  Besides  the  articles,  the  MLAIB  database  includes  references  to  books, 
book chapters and theses (Fitz-Enz, 2008). In terms of chronology, it covers the literary 
critique from 1851 to the present. 

Through the techniques of data mining (Han et al., 2012; Witten et al., 2011), and 
keywords (Callon &Penan, 1993), we initially obtain a sample of the critical bibliography 
about each European national literature. Then, we extract the literary corpus as well as a 
list of the main writers for each country. This allows us tovisualize the importance of each 
of  the48  European  national  literatures  and  to  obtain  a  map  of  the  continental  literary 
field.  

Moreover,  in  order  to  identify  the  tendencies  of  these  indicators,  we  correlate 
them  to  economic  and  development  indicators:  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the 
Human Development Index elaborated by the United Nations. Our purpose, at this stage, 
is  to  observe  whether  and  how  the  different  fields  –cultural,  economic,  and  social– 
interact with each other. 

As  abovementioned,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012)  established  that  big  data  is  «a 
cultural,  technological,  and  scholarly  phenomenon»  (p.  663).  Given  the  actual 
computational capacity of retrieving and storing massive volumes of data, it is possible to 
identify  the  existence  of  patterns  and  to  correlate  different  series.  In  this  sense,  the 
elaboration  of  bibliometric  indicators  for  the  48  European  national  literatures  is  an 
unprecedented  compilation  of  information  about  the  literary  field.We  aim  at  showing 
that  this  field  does  not  stand  alone,  but  is  intertwined  with  other  fields  as  Bourdieu 
points out.

Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  research  is,  firstly,  to  map  the  48  national  literatures  of  Europe,  through  the 
exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  contained  in  the  main  literary  database,  the 
Modern  Language Association International Bibliography.  Secondly, the series  obtained are correlated  to 
economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and 
social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands  at the crossroad 
of  several  concepts:  the  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge  domain 
analysis (Hjørland& Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 
1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; 
Boyd  &  Crawford  2012;  Mayer-Schönberger&  Cukier  2013).  Methodologically,  aiming  at  quantitatively 
identifying the  European  national literatures, we base  our research  on  scientometrics.  Initially developed 
by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological 
activity.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and  features  of  the  Modern 
Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 
1980,  2005;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995)  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  number  of  bibliographic  references 
dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize 
the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators.

Digital humanities and big data 

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of 
digital humanities: 

the  ability  to  read  the  archive  of  core  texts,  together  with  their  residual 
materiality from previous media contexts in order to produce intensive modes of 
engagement  with  particular  documents,  groups  of  texts,  and  the  archive  is 
brought to broader audiences. (Dalbello, 2011, p. 497) 

The  following  year,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012),  define  Big  Data  «as  a  cultural, 
technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology […], 
analysis  […],  mythology»  (Boyd  &  Crawford,  2012,  p.  663).  The  technological  aspect 
corresponds to the capacity of extracting, storing, and putting in relation immense sets 
of  information.  Analytically,  these  massive  amounts  of  information  make  it  possible  to 
identify  patterns  that  allow  us  to  obtain  economic,  social,  and  technical  conclusions 
about the behaviour of the series. The authors consider that the belief that big datasets 
represent superior knowledge capable of yielding truthful, objective, and exact results is 
only a mythology.

In 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger (2013) establish that the phenomenon of 
massive  information  implies  a  change  in  the  way  we  consider  data.  Firstly,  we  can  no 
longer  consider  a  sample  of  data,  since  huge  amounts  of  data  are  available.  However, 
this  considerable  amount  of  information  implies  a  certain  uncleanness  of  information. 
Thus, this change means, secondly, that we have to accept the existence of some inexact 
data, an amount that is meaningless given the quantity of information available. Finally, 
frequently,  this  data  does  not  allow  us  to  know  the  causes  of  the  phenomena 
considered, allowing us only to correlate the series. Thus, there is a displacement from 
the determination of the causes of the events observed to their descriptions: instead of 
explaining the past, the correlations are used to predict the future. Moreover, as Berman 
(2013) points out: «Big Data provides quantitative methods to describe relationships, but 
these  descriptions  must  be  transformed  into  experimentally  verified  explanations»  (p. 
226). In this analysis, we will base our explanation on Bourdieu’s study of the behaviour 
of the literary field (1992). 

Once  the  definitions  of  digital  humanities  and  big  data  established,  we  should 
examine if there is a relation between these concepts. Thus, we have extracted from the 
ISI Web of Knowledge the references that correspond to these concepts. 

Figure 1 represents both series obtained from ISI Web of Knowledge by using the 
keyword technique (Callon &Penan, 1983) with the expressions “digital humanities” and 
“big data” in the title, for all disciplines. We observe that both series begin in the 2000s, 
with  the  exception  of  one  publication  about  big  data  published  in  1974.  However,  the 
publications about big data show a very significant growth since 2012.

Figure 1. Digital Humanities and Big Data - All Disciplines 

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller. 

3  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data 
correspond to business economics (25%) and to library sciences(21%). Finally, there is only 
one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research 
projects that belong, to a certain extent, to both of the abovementioned tendencies. As 
a matter of fact, on the one hand, our research makes use of computing in order to study 
the  behaviour  of  social  sciences,  humanities,  and  arts  issues, particularly, literature.  On 
the other hand, they  are  based on the extraction and analysis of vast amounts  of data. 
Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data,

a  strange  approach  in  literary  studies.  Moretti focuses  on  the  analysis  of  novels,  plots, 
titles, whereas, we study the critical bibliography about literary works, in order to analyze 
the field. 

Again, we meet Moretti’s aim at studying Europe. As he establishes: 

Where  does  the  European  novel  begin?  Who  knows,  who  cares?  But  when  it 
managed to survive and to grow, this is relevant, and this we know: in Europe. In 
the  European  archipelago:  a  space  discontinuous  enough  to  allow  the 
simultaneous exploration of widely different paths. (p. 18) 

Once more, we differ from him, since, in this paper, our purpose is to map the 48 
national 
literatures  of  Europe,  through  the  exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the 
bibliographic references contained in the main literary database, the Modern  Language 
Association International Bibliography, from now on MLAIB.Then, the series obtained are 
correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and 
how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. Thus, we believe 
that our methods and aims fairly complement Moretti’s. 

 

Theory and methodology 

From the theoretical viewpoint, this  project stands at the crossroad of several  notions: 
the  concept  of  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge 
domain  analysis  (Albrechtsen  1997;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995;  Hjorland  2001; 
Nascimento  &  Marteleto  2008),  scientometrics  (Price  1963;  Garfield  1980,  2005; 
Leydesdorff  1998),  and  big  data  (Boyd  & Crawford  2012;  Cukier  &  Mayer-Schoenberger 
2013; Mayer-Schönberger& Cukier 2013). 

According  to  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  society  can  be  defined  as  the 
intertwining  of fields: economic, political, religious, cultural, etc. Each field is organized 
according to its own logic that corresponds to the issues that characterize it. Thus, within 
a field, the interactions between the agents are structured according to their resources: 
economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital. 

In  their  research  about  the  disciplinary  field  of  architecture,  Nascimento  and 
Marteleto  (2008)  reinforced  the  relations  between  the  concept  of  knowledge  domain 
analysis  –developed  by  Hjørland  and  Albrechtsen  (1995),  Albrechtsen  (1997),  and 
Hjørland (2001)– and Bourdieu’s field concept. Particularly, the authors state that: 

it becomes possible to understand how and why informational practice (as social 
practice)  is  constituted  within  a  domain  of  knowledge,  and,  above  all,  interpret 
the  historical,  cultural,  and  social  dimensions  that  influence  the  construction  of 
information. (Nascimento & Marteleto, 2008, p. 402) 

Methodologically,  aiming  at  identifying  the  European  national  literatures  in 
quantitative terms, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price 
(1963),  the  purpose  of  scientometrics  is  to  measure  and  to  analyze  the  scientific  and 
technological  activity.  Its  development  is  due  to  the  foundation  of  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  by  Eugene  Garfield,  nowadays 
internationally  renowned  as 
Thomson  ISI.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and 
features of the abovementioned MLAIB. This electronic bibliography, the most important 

5  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 
one  in  literary  studies,  contains  over  2,200,000  references  and  includes  approximately 
4,400  journals.  Besides  the  articles,  the  MLAIB  database  includes  references  to  books, 
book chapters and theses (Fitz-Enz, 2008). In terms of chronology, it covers the literary 
critique from 1851 to the present. 

Through the techniques of data mining (Han et al., 2012; Witten et al., 2011), and 
keywords (Callon &Penan, 1993), we initially obtain a sample of the critical bibliography 
about each European national literature. Then, we extract the literary corpus as well as a 
list of the main writers for each country. This allows us tovisualize the importance of each 
of  the48  European  national  literatures  and  to  obtain  a  map  of  the  continental  literary 
field.  

Moreover,  in  order  to  identify  the  tendencies  of  these  indicators,  we  correlate 
them  to  economic  and  development  indicators:  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the 
Human Development Index elaborated by the United Nations. Our purpose, at this stage, 
is  to  observe  whether  and  how  the  different  fields  –cultural,  economic,  and  social– 
interact with each other. 

As  abovementioned,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012)  established  that  big  data  is  «a 
cultural,  technological,  and  scholarly  phenomenon»  (p.  663).  Given  the  actual 
computational capacity of retrieving and storing massive volumes of data, it is possible to 
identify  the  existence  of  patterns  and  to  correlate  different  series.  In  this  sense,  the 
elaboration  of  bibliometric  indicators  for  the  48  European  national  literatures  is  an 
unprecedented  compilation  of  information  about  the  literary  field.We  aim  at  showing 
that  this  field  does  not  stand  alone,  but  is  intertwined  with  other  fields  as  Bourdieu 
points out.

Figure 3. Critical Bibliography 

 

The European literary field 

The  total set obtained for European literature contains 1,166,392 references, covering a 
period of 163 years, from1851 until 2014. Figure 3 represents the number of references for

each  of  the  48  national  literatures,  in  thousands  of  references.  As  we  can  observe,  7 
countries  clearly  stand out:  United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Italy,  Russia,  and 
Ireland.    Each  of  these  national  literatures  has  over  50,000  cumulated  critical  literary 
references. 

Figure 4 shows the number of authors that have been the object of at least 100 
publications. United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy have more than 100 writers in 
this situation. 

In terms of the number of works that have 100 or more references, Figure 5, only 2 

countries pass the bar of 100 titles: United Kingdom and France.

Mapping European Literatures in the 21st Century

Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  research  is,  firstly,  to  map  the  48  national  literatures  of  Europe,  through  the 
exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  contained  in  the  main  literary  database,  the 
Modern  Language Association International Bibliography.  Secondly, the series  obtained are correlated  to 
economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and 
social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands  at the crossroad 
of  several  concepts:  the  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge  domain 
analysis (Hjørland& Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 
1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; 
Boyd  &  Crawford  2012;  Mayer-Schönberger&  Cukier  2013).  Methodologically,  aiming  at  quantitatively 
identifying the  European  national literatures, we base  our research  on  scientometrics.  Initially developed 
by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological 
activity.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and  features  of  the  Modern 
Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 
1980,  2005;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995)  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  number  of  bibliographic  references 
dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize 
the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators.

Digital humanities and big data 

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of 
digital humanities: 

the  ability  to  read  the  archive  of  core  texts,  together  with  their  residual 
materiality from previous media contexts in order to produce intensive modes of 
engagement  with  particular  documents,  groups  of  texts,  and  the  archive  is 
brought to broader audiences. (Dalbello, 2011, p. 497) 

The  following  year,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012),  define  Big  Data  «as  a  cultural, 
technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology […], 
analysis  […],  mythology»  (Boyd  &  Crawford,  2012,  p.  663).  The  technological  aspect 
corresponds to the capacity of extracting, storing, and putting in relation immense sets 
of  information.  Analytically,  these  massive  amounts  of  information  make  it  possible  to 
identify  patterns  that  allow  us  to  obtain  economic,  social,  and  technical  conclusions 
about the behaviour of the series. The authors consider that the belief that big datasets 
represent superior knowledge capable of yielding truthful, objective, and exact results is 
only a mythology.

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

In 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger (2013) establish that the phenomenon of 
massive  information  implies  a  change  in  the  way  we  consider  data.  Firstly,  we  can  no 
longer  consider  a  sample  of  data,  since  huge  amounts  of  data  are  available.  However, 
this  considerable  amount  of  information  implies  a  certain  uncleanness  of  information. 
Thus, this change means, secondly, that we have to accept the existence of some inexact 
data, an amount that is meaningless given the quantity of information available. Finally, 
frequently,  this  data  does  not  allow  us  to  know  the  causes  of  the  phenomena 
considered, allowing us only to correlate the series. Thus, there is a displacement from 
the determination of the causes of the events observed to their descriptions: instead of 
explaining the past, the correlations are used to predict the future. Moreover, as Berman 
(2013) points out: «Big Data provides quantitative methods to describe relationships, but 
these  descriptions  must  be  transformed  into  experimentally  verified  explanations»  (p. 
226). In this analysis, we will base our explanation on Bourdieu’s study of the behaviour 
of the literary field (1992). 

Once  the  definitions  of  digital  humanities  and  big  data  established,  we  should 
examine if there is a relation between these concepts. Thus, we have extracted from the 
ISI Web of Knowledge the references that correspond to these concepts. 

Figure 1 represents both series obtained from ISI Web of Knowledge by using the 
keyword technique (Callon &Penan, 1983) with the expressions “digital humanities” and 
“big data” in the title, for all disciplines. We observe that both series begin in the 2000s, 
with  the  exception  of  one  publication  about  big  data  published  in  1974.  However,  the 
publications about big data show a very significant growth since 2012.

Figure 1. Digital Humanities and Big Data - All Disciplines 

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller. 

3  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data 
correspond to business economics (25%) and to library sciences(21%). Finally, there is only 
one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research 
projects that belong, to a certain extent, to both of the abovementioned tendencies. As 
a matter of fact, on the one hand, our research makes use of computing in order to study 
the  behaviour  of  social  sciences,  humanities,  and  arts  issues, particularly, literature.  On 
the other hand, they  are  based on the extraction and analysis of vast amounts  of data. 
Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data,

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

a  strange  approach  in  literary  studies.  Moretti focuses  on  the  analysis  of  novels,  plots, 
titles, whereas, we study the critical bibliography about literary works, in order to analyze 
the field. 

Again, we meet Moretti’s aim at studying Europe. As he establishes: 

Where  does  the  European  novel  begin?  Who  knows,  who  cares?  But  when  it 
managed to survive and to grow, this is relevant, and this we know: in Europe. In 
the  European  archipelago:  a  space  discontinuous  enough  to  allow  the 
simultaneous exploration of widely different paths. (p. 18) 

Once more, we differ from him, since, in this paper, our purpose is to map the 48 
national 
literatures  of  Europe,  through  the  exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the 
bibliographic references contained in the main literary database, the Modern  Language 
Association International Bibliography, from now on MLAIB.Then, the series obtained are 
correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and 
how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. Thus, we believe 
that our methods and aims fairly complement Moretti’s. 

 

Theory and methodology 

From the theoretical viewpoint, this  project stands at the crossroad of several  notions: 
the  concept  of  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge 
domain  analysis  (Albrechtsen  1997;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995;  Hjorland  2001; 
Nascimento  &  Marteleto  2008),  scientometrics  (Price  1963;  Garfield  1980,  2005; 
Leydesdorff  1998),  and  big  data  (Boyd  & Crawford  2012;  Cukier  &  Mayer-Schoenberger 
2013; Mayer-Schönberger& Cukier 2013). 

According  to  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  society  can  be  defined  as  the 
intertwining  of fields: economic, political, religious, cultural, etc. Each field is organized 
according to its own logic that corresponds to the issues that characterize it. Thus, within 
a field, the interactions between the agents are structured according to their resources: 
economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital. 

In  their  research  about  the  disciplinary  field  of  architecture,  Nascimento  and 
Marteleto  (2008)  reinforced  the  relations  between  the  concept  of  knowledge  domain 
analysis  –developed  by  Hjørland  and  Albrechtsen  (1995),  Albrechtsen  (1997),  and 
Hjørland (2001)– and Bourdieu’s field concept. Particularly, the authors state that: 

it becomes possible to understand how and why informational practice (as social 
practice)  is  constituted  within  a  domain  of  knowledge,  and,  above  all,  interpret 
the  historical,  cultural,  and  social  dimensions  that  influence  the  construction  of 
information. (Nascimento & Marteleto, 2008, p. 402) 

Methodologically,  aiming  at  identifying  the  European  national  literatures  in 
quantitative terms, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price 
(1963),  the  purpose  of  scientometrics  is  to  measure  and  to  analyze  the  scientific  and 
technological  activity.  Its  development  is  due  to  the  foundation  of  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  by  Eugene  Garfield,  nowadays 
internationally  renowned  as 
Thomson  ISI.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and 
features of the abovementioned MLAIB. This electronic bibliography, the most important 

5  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 
one  in  literary  studies,  contains  over  2,200,000  references  and  includes  approximately 
4,400  journals.  Besides  the  articles,  the  MLAIB  database  includes  references  to  books, 
book chapters and theses (Fitz-Enz, 2008). In terms of chronology, it covers the literary 
critique from 1851 to the present. 

Through the techniques of data mining (Han et al., 2012; Witten et al., 2011), and 
keywords (Callon &Penan, 1993), we initially obtain a sample of the critical bibliography 
about each European national literature. Then, we extract the literary corpus as well as a 
list of the main writers for each country. This allows us tovisualize the importance of each 
of  the48  European  national  literatures  and  to  obtain  a  map  of  the  continental  literary 
field.  

Moreover,  in  order  to  identify  the  tendencies  of  these  indicators,  we  correlate 
them  to  economic  and  development  indicators:  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the 
Human Development Index elaborated by the United Nations. Our purpose, at this stage, 
is  to  observe  whether  and  how  the  different  fields  –cultural,  economic,  and  social– 
interact with each other. 

As  abovementioned,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012)  established  that  big  data  is  «a 
cultural,  technological,  and  scholarly  phenomenon»  (p.  663).  Given  the  actual 
computational capacity of retrieving and storing massive volumes of data, it is possible to 
identify  the  existence  of  patterns  and  to  correlate  different  series.  In  this  sense,  the 
elaboration  of  bibliometric  indicators  for  the  48  European  national  literatures  is  an 
unprecedented  compilation  of  information  about  the  literary  field.We  aim  at  showing 
that  this  field  does  not  stand  alone,  but  is  intertwined  with  other  fields  as  Bourdieu 
points out.

Figure 3. Critical Bibliography 

 

The European literary field 

The  total set obtained for European literature contains 1,166,392 references, covering a 
period of 163 years, from1851 until 2014. Figure 3 represents the number of references for

each  of  the  48  national  literatures,  in  thousands  of  references.  As  we  can  observe,  7 
countries  clearly  stand out:  United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Italy,  Russia,  and 
Ireland.    Each  of  these  national  literatures  has  over  50,000  cumulated  critical  literary 
references. 

Figure 4 shows the number of authors that have been the object of at least 100 
publications. United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy have more than 100 writers in 
this situation. 

In terms of the number of works that have 100 or more references, Figure 5, only 2 

countries pass the bar of 100 titles: United Kingdom and France.

7  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Now,  if  we  consider  Table  1,  we  observe  that  only  17  countries  individually 
represent  more  than  0.5%  of  European  literature.  In  fact,  the  first  5  countries  –United 
Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  and  Italy–  cumulate  78%  of  the  critical  bibliography 
about  European  literature.  Altogether,  those  countries  with  less  than  0.5%  of  the 
references  represent less  than  3.4%  of  the  total  bibliography. This  data  shows  that  the 
critical  bibliography  about  this  literary  field  has  evolved  very  differently  across  the 
continent.  On  the  one  hand,  there  are  some  extremely  developed  critical  national 
systems, such as the  abovementioned top 7 countries. On the  other  hand, 31 countries 
cumulate  less  than  7,000  critical  references,  showing  an  embryonic  state  of  either  the 
literature  or  the  critical  apparatus  about  it.  Between  these  two  extremes,  we  find  10 
considerably  developed  national 
literatures,  whose  number  of  references  ranges 
between 7,000 and 17,000 publications.

Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: 
Mapping European Literatures in the 21st Century

Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  research  is,  firstly,  to  map  the  48  national  literatures  of  Europe,  through  the 
exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  contained  in  the  main  literary  database,  the 
Modern  Language Association International Bibliography.  Secondly, the series  obtained are correlated  to 
economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and 
social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands  at the crossroad 
of  several  concepts:  the  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge  domain 
analysis (Hjørland& Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 
1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; 
Boyd  &  Crawford  2012;  Mayer-Schönberger&  Cukier  2013).  Methodologically,  aiming  at  quantitatively 
identifying the  European  national literatures, we base  our research  on  scientometrics.  Initially developed 
by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological 
activity.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and  features  of  the  Modern 
Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 
1980,  2005;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995)  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  number  of  bibliographic  references 
dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize 
the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators.

Digital humanities and big data 

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of 
digital humanities: 

the  ability  to  read  the  archive  of  core  texts,  together  with  their  residual 
materiality from previous media contexts in order to produce intensive modes of 
engagement  with  particular  documents,  groups  of  texts,  and  the  archive  is 
brought to broader audiences. (Dalbello, 2011, p. 497) 

The  following  year,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012),  define  Big  Data  «as  a  cultural, 
technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology […], 
analysis  […],  mythology»  (Boyd  &  Crawford,  2012,  p.  663).  The  technological  aspect 
corresponds to the capacity of extracting, storing, and putting in relation immense sets 
of  information.  Analytically,  these  massive  amounts  of  information  make  it  possible  to 
identify  patterns  that  allow  us  to  obtain  economic,  social,  and  technical  conclusions 
about the behaviour of the series. The authors consider that the belief that big datasets 
represent superior knowledge capable of yielding truthful, objective, and exact results is 
only a mythology.

In 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger (2013) establish that the phenomenon of 
massive  information  implies  a  change  in  the  way  we  consider  data.  Firstly,  we  can  no 
longer  consider  a  sample  of  data,  since  huge  amounts  of  data  are  available.  However, 
this  considerable  amount  of  information  implies  a  certain  uncleanness  of  information. 
Thus, this change means, secondly, that we have to accept the existence of some inexact 
data, an amount that is meaningless given the quantity of information available. Finally, 
frequently,  this  data  does  not  allow  us  to  know  the  causes  of  the  phenomena 
considered, allowing us only to correlate the series. Thus, there is a displacement from 
the determination of the causes of the events observed to their descriptions: instead of 
explaining the past, the correlations are used to predict the future. Moreover, as Berman 
(2013) points out: «Big Data provides quantitative methods to describe relationships, but 
these  descriptions  must  be  transformed  into  experimentally  verified  explanations»  (p. 
226). In this analysis, we will base our explanation on Bourdieu’s study of the behaviour 
of the literary field (1992). 

Once  the  definitions  of  digital  humanities  and  big  data  established,  we  should 
examine if there is a relation between these concepts. Thus, we have extracted from the 
ISI Web of Knowledge the references that correspond to these concepts. 

Figure 1 represents both series obtained from ISI Web of Knowledge by using the 
keyword technique (Callon &Penan, 1983) with the expressions “digital humanities” and 
“big data” in the title, for all disciplines. We observe that both series begin in the 2000s, 
with  the  exception  of  one  publication  about  big  data  published  in  1974.  However,  the 
publications about big data show a very significant growth since 2012.

Figure 1. Digital Humanities and Big Data - All Disciplines 

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller. 

3  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data 
correspond to business economics (25%) and to library sciences(21%). Finally, there is only 
one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research 
projects that belong, to a certain extent, to both of the abovementioned tendencies. As 
a matter of fact, on the one hand, our research makes use of computing in order to study 
the  behaviour  of  social  sciences,  humanities,  and  arts  issues, particularly, literature.  On 
the other hand, they  are  based on the extraction and analysis of vast amounts  of data. 
Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data, 

 

4 

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

a  strange  approach  in  literary  studies.  Moretti focuses  on  the  analysis  of  novels,  plots, 
titles, whereas, we study the critical bibliography about literary works, in order to analyze 
the field. 

Again, we meet Moretti’s aim at studying Europe. As he establishes: 

Where  does  the  European  novel  begin?  Who  knows,  who  cares?  But  when  it 
managed to survive and to grow, this is relevant, and this we know: in Europe. In 
the  European  archipelago:  a  space  discontinuous  enough  to  allow  the 
simultaneous exploration of widely different paths. (p. 18) 

Once more, we differ from him, since, in this paper, our purpose is to map the 48 
national 
literatures  of  Europe,  through  the  exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the 
bibliographic references contained in the main literary database, the Modern  Language 
Association International Bibliography, from now on MLAIB.Then, the series obtained are 
correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and 
how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. Thus, we believe 
that our methods and aims fairly complement Moretti’s. 

 

Theory and methodology 

From the theoretical viewpoint, this  project stands at the crossroad of several  notions: 
the  concept  of  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge 
domain  analysis  (Albrechtsen  1997;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995;  Hjorland  2001; 
Nascimento  &  Marteleto  2008),  scientometrics  (Price  1963;  Garfield  1980,  2005; 
Leydesdorff  1998),  and  big  data  (Boyd  & Crawford  2012;  Cukier  &  Mayer-Schoenberger 
2013; Mayer-Schönberger& Cukier 2013). 

According  to  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  society  can  be  defined  as  the 
intertwining  of fields: economic, political, religious, cultural, etc. Each field is organized 
according to its own logic that corresponds to the issues that characterize it. Thus, within 
a field, the interactions between the agents are structured according to their resources: 
economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital. 

In  their  research  about  the  disciplinary  field  of  architecture,  Nascimento  and 
Marteleto  (2008)  reinforced  the  relations  between  the  concept  of  knowledge  domain 
analysis  –developed  by  Hjørland  and  Albrechtsen  (1995),  Albrechtsen  (1997),  and 
Hjørland (2001)– and Bourdieu’s field concept. Particularly, the authors state that: 

it becomes possible to understand how and why informational practice (as social 
practice)  is  constituted  within  a  domain  of  knowledge,  and,  above  all,  interpret 
the  historical,  cultural,  and  social  dimensions  that  influence  the  construction  of 
information. (Nascimento & Marteleto, 2008, p. 402) 

Methodologically,  aiming  at  identifying  the  European  national  literatures  in 
quantitative terms, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price 
(1963),  the  purpose  of  scientometrics  is  to  measure  and  to  analyze  the  scientific  and 
technological  activity.  Its  development  is  due  to  the  foundation  of  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  by  Eugene  Garfield,  nowadays 
internationally  renowned  as 
Thomson  ISI.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and 
features of the abovementioned MLAIB. This electronic bibliography, the most important 

5  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 
one  in  literary  studies,  contains  over  2,200,000  references  and  includes  approximately 
4,400  journals.  Besides  the  articles,  the  MLAIB  database  includes  references  to  books, 
book chapters and theses (Fitz-Enz, 2008). In terms of chronology, it covers the literary 
critique from 1851 to the present. 

Through the techniques of data mining (Han et al., 2012; Witten et al., 2011), and 
keywords (Callon &Penan, 1993), we initially obtain a sample of the critical bibliography 
about each European national literature. Then, we extract the literary corpus as well as a 
list of the main writers for each country. This allows us tovisualize the importance of each 
of  the48  European  national  literatures  and  to  obtain  a  map  of  the  continental  literary 
field.  

Moreover,  in  order  to  identify  the  tendencies  of  these  indicators,  we  correlate 
them  to  economic  and  development  indicators:  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the 
Human Development Index elaborated by the United Nations. Our purpose, at this stage, 
is  to  observe  whether  and  how  the  different  fields  –cultural,  economic,  and  social– 
interact with each other. 

As  abovementioned,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012)  established  that  big  data  is  «a 
cultural,  technological,  and  scholarly  phenomenon»  (p.  663).  Given  the  actual 
computational capacity of retrieving and storing massive volumes of data, it is possible to 
identify  the  existence  of  patterns  and  to  correlate  different  series.  In  this  sense,  the 
elaboration  of  bibliometric  indicators  for  the  48  European  national  literatures  is  an 
unprecedented  compilation  of  information  about  the  literary  field.We  aim  at  showing 
that  this  field  does  not  stand  alone,  but  is  intertwined  with  other  fields  as  Bourdieu 
points out.

Figure 3. Critical Bibliography 

 

The European literary field 

The  total set obtained for European literature contains 1,166,392 references, covering a 
period of 163 years, from1851 until 2014. Figure 3 represents the number of references for

each  of  the  48  national  literatures,  in  thousands  of  references.  As  we  can  observe,  7 
countries  clearly  stand out:  United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Italy,  Russia,  and 
Ireland.    Each  of  these  national  literatures  has  over  50,000  cumulated  critical  literary 
references. 

Figure 4 shows the number of authors that have been the object of at least 100 
publications. United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy have more than 100 writers in 
this situation. 

In terms of the number of works that have 100 or more references, Figure 5, only 2 

countries pass the bar of 100 titles: United Kingdom and France.

7  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Now,  if  we  consider  Table  1,  we  observe  that  only  17  countries  individually 
represent  more  than  0.5%  of  European  literature.  In  fact,  the  first  5  countries  –United 
Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  and  Italy–  cumulate  78%  of  the  critical  bibliography 
about  European  literature.  Altogether,  those  countries  with  less  than  0.5%  of  the 
references  represent less  than  3.4%  of  the  total  bibliography. This  data  shows  that  the 
critical  bibliography  about  this  literary  field  has  evolved  very  differently  across  the 
continent.  On  the  one  hand,  there  are  some  extremely  developed  critical  national 
systems, such as the  abovementioned top 7 countries. On the  other  hand, 31 countries 
cumulate  less  than  7,000  critical  references,  showing  an  embryonic  state  of  either  the 
literature  or  the  critical  apparatus  about  it.  Between  these  two  extremes,  we  find  10 
considerably  developed  national 
literatures,  whose  number  of  references  ranges 
between 7,000 and 17,000 publications.

Cultural, economic, and social indicators 

If we now turn to socio-economic indexes, there are several indicators calculated by the 
United  Nations  (United  Nations  Statistics  Division  and  United  Nations  Development 
Programme)that  we  may  want  to  consider.  Firstly,  we  can  observe,  Figure  6,  that  9 
countries have populations, in millions of inhabitants, well above the European average 
of  17  million  people.  In  fact,  3  countries  clearly  lead  in  terms  of  population:  Russia, 
Germany and Turkey.

Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: 
Mapping European Literatures in the 21st Century

Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  research  is,  firstly,  to  map  the  48  national  literatures  of  Europe,  through  the 
exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  contained  in  the  main  literary  database,  the 
Modern  Language Association International Bibliography.  Secondly, the series  obtained are correlated  to 
economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and 
social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands  at the crossroad 
of  several  concepts:  the  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge  domain 
analysis (Hjørland& Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 
1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; 
Boyd  &  Crawford  2012;  Mayer-Schönberger&  Cukier  2013).  Methodologically,  aiming  at  quantitatively 
identifying the  European  national literatures, we base  our research  on  scientometrics.  Initially developed 
by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological 
activity.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and  features  of  the  Modern 
Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 
1980,  2005;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995)  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  number  of  bibliographic  references 
dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize 
the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators.

Digital humanities and big data 

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of 
digital humanities: 

the  ability  to  read  the  archive  of  core  texts,  together  with  their  residual 
materiality from previous media contexts in order to produce intensive modes of 
engagement  with  particular  documents,  groups  of  texts,  and  the  archive  is 
brought to broader audiences. (Dalbello, 2011, p. 497) 

The  following  year,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012),  define  Big  Data  «as  a  cultural, 
technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology […], 
analysis  […],  mythology»  (Boyd  &  Crawford,  2012,  p.  663).  The  technological  aspect 
corresponds to the capacity of extracting, storing, and putting in relation immense sets 
of  information.  Analytically,  these  massive  amounts  of  information  make  it  possible  to 
identify  patterns  that  allow  us  to  obtain  economic,  social,  and  technical  conclusions 
about the behaviour of the series. The authors consider that the belief that big datasets 
represent superior knowledge capable of yielding truthful, objective, and exact results is 
only a mythology.

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

In 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger (2013) establish that the phenomenon of 
massive  information  implies  a  change  in  the  way  we  consider  data.  Firstly,  we  can  no 
longer  consider  a  sample  of  data,  since  huge  amounts  of  data  are  available.  However, 
this  considerable  amount  of  information  implies  a  certain  uncleanness  of  information. 
Thus, this change means, secondly, that we have to accept the existence of some inexact 
data, an amount that is meaningless given the quantity of information available. Finally, 
frequently,  this  data  does  not  allow  us  to  know  the  causes  of  the  phenomena 
considered, allowing us only to correlate the series. Thus, there is a displacement from 
the determination of the causes of the events observed to their descriptions: instead of 
explaining the past, the correlations are used to predict the future. Moreover, as Berman 
(2013) points out: «Big Data provides quantitative methods to describe relationships, but 
these  descriptions  must  be  transformed  into  experimentally  verified  explanations»  (p. 
226). In this analysis, we will base our explanation on Bourdieu’s study of the behaviour 
of the literary field (1992). 

Once  the  definitions  of  digital  humanities  and  big  data  established,  we  should 
examine if there is a relation between these concepts. Thus, we have extracted from the 
ISI Web of Knowledge the references that correspond to these concepts. 

Figure 1 represents both series obtained from ISI Web of Knowledge by using the 
keyword technique (Callon &Penan, 1983) with the expressions “digital humanities” and 
“big data” in the title, for all disciplines. We observe that both series begin in the 2000s, 
with  the  exception  of  one  publication  about  big  data  published  in  1974.  However,  the 
publications about big data show a very significant growth since 2012.

Figure 1. Digital Humanities and Big Data - All Disciplines 

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller.

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data 
correspond to business economics (25%) and to library sciences(21%). Finally, there is only 
one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research 
projects that belong, to a certain extent, to both of the abovementioned tendencies. As 
a matter of fact, on the one hand, our research makes use of computing in order to study 
the  behaviour  of  social  sciences,  humanities,  and  arts  issues, particularly, literature.  On 
the other hand, they  are  based on the extraction and analysis of vast amounts  of data. 
Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data, 

 

4 

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

a  strange  approach  in  literary  studies.  Moretti focuses  on  the  analysis  of  novels,  plots, 
titles, whereas, we study the critical bibliography about literary works, in order to analyze 
the field. 

Again, we meet Moretti’s aim at studying Europe. As he establishes: 

Where  does  the  European  novel  begin?  Who  knows,  who  cares?  But  when  it 
managed to survive and to grow, this is relevant, and this we know: in Europe. In 
the  European  archipelago:  a  space  discontinuous  enough  to  allow  the 
simultaneous exploration of widely different paths. (p. 18) 

Once more, we differ from him, since, in this paper, our purpose is to map the 48 
national 
literatures  of  Europe,  through  the  exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the 
bibliographic references contained in the main literary database, the Modern  Language 
Association International Bibliography, from now on MLAIB.Then, the series obtained are 
correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and 
how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. Thus, we believe 
that our methods and aims fairly complement Moretti’s. 

 

Theory and methodology 

From the theoretical viewpoint, this  project stands at the crossroad of several  notions: 
the  concept  of  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge 
domain  analysis  (Albrechtsen  1997;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995;  Hjorland  2001; 
Nascimento  &  Marteleto  2008),  scientometrics  (Price  1963;  Garfield  1980,  2005; 
Leydesdorff  1998),  and  big  data  (Boyd  & Crawford  2012;  Cukier  &  Mayer-Schoenberger 
2013; Mayer-Schönberger& Cukier 2013). 

According  to  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  society  can  be  defined  as  the 
intertwining  of fields: economic, political, religious, cultural, etc. Each field is organized 
according to its own logic that corresponds to the issues that characterize it. Thus, within 
a field, the interactions between the agents are structured according to their resources: 
economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital. 

In  their  research  about  the  disciplinary  field  of  architecture,  Nascimento  and 
Marteleto  (2008)  reinforced  the  relations  between  the  concept  of  knowledge  domain 
analysis  –developed  by  Hjørland  and  Albrechtsen  (1995),  Albrechtsen  (1997),  and 
Hjørland (2001)– and Bourdieu’s field concept. Particularly, the authors state that: 

it becomes possible to understand how and why informational practice (as social 
practice)  is  constituted  within  a  domain  of  knowledge,  and,  above  all,  interpret 
the  historical,  cultural,  and  social  dimensions  that  influence  the  construction  of 
information. (Nascimento & Marteleto, 2008, p. 402) 

Methodologically,  aiming  at  identifying  the  European  national  literatures  in 
quantitative terms, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price 
(1963),  the  purpose  of  scientometrics  is  to  measure  and  to  analyze  the  scientific  and 
technological  activity.  Its  development  is  due  to  the  foundation  of  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  by  Eugene  Garfield,  nowadays 
internationally  renowned  as 
Thomson  ISI.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and 
features of the abovementioned MLAIB. This electronic bibliography, the most important 

5  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 
one  in  literary  studies,  contains  over  2,200,000  references  and  includes  approximately 
4,400  journals.  Besides  the  articles,  the  MLAIB  database  includes  references  to  books, 
book chapters and theses (Fitz-Enz, 2008). In terms of chronology, it covers the literary 
critique from 1851 to the present. 

Through the techniques of data mining (Han et al., 2012; Witten et al., 2011), and 
keywords (Callon &Penan, 1993), we initially obtain a sample of the critical bibliography 
about each European national literature. Then, we extract the literary corpus as well as a 
list of the main writers for each country. This allows us tovisualize the importance of each 
of  the48  European  national  literatures  and  to  obtain  a  map  of  the  continental  literary 
field.  

Moreover,  in  order  to  identify  the  tendencies  of  these  indicators,  we  correlate 
them  to  economic  and  development  indicators:  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the 
Human Development Index elaborated by the United Nations. Our purpose, at this stage, 
is  to  observe  whether  and  how  the  different  fields  –cultural,  economic,  and  social– 
interact with each other. 

As  abovementioned,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012)  established  that  big  data  is  «a 
cultural,  technological,  and  scholarly  phenomenon»  (p.  663).  Given  the  actual 
computational capacity of retrieving and storing massive volumes of data, it is possible to 
identify  the  existence  of  patterns  and  to  correlate  different  series.  In  this  sense,  the 
elaboration  of  bibliometric  indicators  for  the  48  European  national  literatures  is  an 
unprecedented  compilation  of  information  about  the  literary  field.We  aim  at  showing 
that  this  field  does  not  stand  alone,  but  is  intertwined  with  other  fields  as  Bourdieu 
points out.

Figure 3. Critical Bibliography 

 

The European literary field 

The  total set obtained for European literature contains 1,166,392 references, covering a 
period of 163 years, from1851 until 2014. Figure 3 represents the number of references for

each  of  the  48  national  literatures,  in  thousands  of  references.  As  we  can  observe,  7 
countries  clearly  stand out:  United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Italy,  Russia,  and 
Ireland.    Each  of  these  national  literatures  has  over  50,000  cumulated  critical  literary 
references. 

Figure 4 shows the number of authors that have been the object of at least 100 
publications. United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy have more than 100 writers in 
this situation. 

In terms of the number of works that have 100 or more references, Figure 5, only 2 

countries pass the bar of 100 titles: United Kingdom and France.

7  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Now,  if  we  consider  Table  1,  we  observe  that  only  17  countries  individually 
represent  more  than  0.5%  of  European  literature.  In  fact,  the  first  5  countries  –United 
Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  and  Italy–  cumulate  78%  of  the  critical  bibliography 
about  European  literature.  Altogether,  those  countries  with  less  than  0.5%  of  the 
references  represent less  than  3.4%  of  the  total  bibliography. This  data  shows  that  the 
critical  bibliography  about  this  literary  field  has  evolved  very  differently  across  the 
continent.  On  the  one  hand,  there  are  some  extremely  developed  critical  national 
systems, such as the  abovementioned top 7 countries. On the  other  hand, 31 countries 
cumulate  less  than  7,000  critical  references,  showing  an  embryonic  state  of  either  the 
literature  or  the  critical  apparatus  about  it.  Between  these  two  extremes,  we  find  10 
considerably  developed  national 
literatures,  whose  number  of  references  ranges 
between 7,000 and 17,000 publications.

Cultural, economic, and social indicators 

If we now turn to socio-economic indexes, there are several indicators calculated by the 
United  Nations  (United  Nations  Statistics  Division  and  United  Nations  Development 
Programme)that  we  may  want  to  consider.  Firstly,  we  can  observe,  Figure  6,  that  9 
countries have populations, in millions of inhabitants, well above the European average 
of  17  million  people.  In  fact,  3  countries  clearly  lead  in  terms  of  population:  Russia, 
Germany and Turkey.

Figure 7. Gross National Income 

In  terms  of  Gross  National  Income,  expressed  in  millions  of  2012  US$,  Figure  7, 
Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Russia stand out as the leaders. However, if 
we consider the Gross National Income per capita, the cartography is very different. In 
this  case,  Liechtenstein,  Norway,  and  Luxembourg  emerge  as  the  countries  with  the 
highest per capita income. 

Finally,  Figure  8  represents  the  values  of  the  Human  Development  Index.  This 
indicator  ranges  from  0  to  1  and  is  a:  «way  of  measuring  development  by  combining 
indicators  of  life  expectancy,  educational  attainment  and  income»  (UNDP).Norway  has 
the highest HDI, 0.955, whereas  the Republic of Moldova holds the lowest one, 0.660. 
This index is not calculated for every  country; thus, there is no indicator for Greenland, 
Kosovo, Monaco, and San Marino.

Indicators and Literature  

All along, we have been collecting data in order to answer basically one question: is there 
a  relation  between  a  country’s  cultural,  economic,  and  social  development  and  the 
importance of its national literature, measured through the critical bibliography? 

In order to answer it, we calculated several correlation coefficients. Table 2 shows 
the  results  of  these  correlations.  As  we  can  observe,  there  is  an  important  positive 
correlation  between  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the  number  of  authors  with  100 
references or more, 0.85, as well as between the Gross National Income and the number 
of references, 0.84. Also, there is a light positive correlation between the Gross National 
Income and the number of works with 100 references or more, 0.71, as well as between 
the  population  and  the  number  of  authors  with  100  references  or  more,  0.62,  and 
between  the  population  and  the  number  of  references,  0.60.  All  the  other  coefficients 
are inferior to 0.50, thus, showing no relation between the indicators.

Mapping European Literatures in the 21st Century

Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  research  is,  firstly,  to  map  the  48  national  literatures  of  Europe,  through  the 
exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  contained  in  the  main  literary  database,  the 
Modern  Language Association International Bibliography.  Secondly, the series  obtained are correlated  to 
economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and 
social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands  at the crossroad 
of  several  concepts:  the  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge  domain 
analysis (Hjørland& Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 
1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; 
Boyd  &  Crawford  2012;  Mayer-Schönberger&  Cukier  2013).  Methodologically,  aiming  at  quantitatively 
identifying the  European  national literatures, we base  our research  on  scientometrics.  Initially developed 
by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological 
activity.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and  features  of  the  Modern 
Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 
1980,  2005;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995)  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  number  of  bibliographic  references 
dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize 
the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators.

Digital humanities and big data 

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of 
digital humanities: 

the  ability  to  read  the  archive  of  core  texts,  together  with  their  residual 
materiality from previous media contexts in order to produce intensive modes of 
engagement  with  particular  documents,  groups  of  texts,  and  the  archive  is 
brought to broader audiences. (Dalbello, 2011, p. 497) 

The  following  year,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012),  define  Big  Data  «as  a  cultural, 
technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology […], 
analysis  […],  mythology»  (Boyd  &  Crawford,  2012,  p.  663).  The  technological  aspect 
corresponds to the capacity of extracting, storing, and putting in relation immense sets 
of  information.  Analytically,  these  massive  amounts  of  information  make  it  possible  to 
identify  patterns  that  allow  us  to  obtain  economic,  social,  and  technical  conclusions 
about the behaviour of the series. The authors consider that the belief that big datasets 
represent superior knowledge capable of yielding truthful, objective, and exact results is 
only a mythology.

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

In 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger (2013) establish that the phenomenon of 
massive  information  implies  a  change  in  the  way  we  consider  data.  Firstly,  we  can  no 
longer  consider  a  sample  of  data,  since  huge  amounts  of  data  are  available.  However, 
this  considerable  amount  of  information  implies  a  certain  uncleanness  of  information. 
Thus, this change means, secondly, that we have to accept the existence of some inexact 
data, an amount that is meaningless given the quantity of information available. Finally, 
frequently,  this  data  does  not  allow  us  to  know  the  causes  of  the  phenomena 
considered, allowing us only to correlate the series. Thus, there is a displacement from 
the determination of the causes of the events observed to their descriptions: instead of 
explaining the past, the correlations are used to predict the future. Moreover, as Berman 
(2013) points out: «Big Data provides quantitative methods to describe relationships, but 
these  descriptions  must  be  transformed  into  experimentally  verified  explanations»  (p. 
226). In this analysis, we will base our explanation on Bourdieu’s study of the behaviour 
of the literary field (1992). 

Once  the  definitions  of  digital  humanities  and  big  data  established,  we  should 
examine if there is a relation between these concepts. Thus, we have extracted from the 
ISI Web of Knowledge the references that correspond to these concepts. 

Figure 1 represents both series obtained from ISI Web of Knowledge by using the 
keyword technique (Callon &Penan, 1983) with the expressions “digital humanities” and 
“big data” in the title, for all disciplines. We observe that both series begin in the 2000s, 
with  the  exception  of  one  publication  about  big  data  published  in  1974.  However,  the 
publications about big data show a very significant growth since 2012.

Figure 1. Digital Humanities and Big Data - All Disciplines 

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller. 

3  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data 
correspond to business economics (25%) and to library sciences(21%). Finally, there is only 
one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research 
projects that belong, to a certain extent, to both of the abovementioned tendencies. As 
a matter of fact, on the one hand, our research makes use of computing in order to study 
the  behaviour  of  social  sciences,  humanities,  and  arts  issues, particularly, literature.  On 
the other hand, they  are  based on the extraction and analysis of vast amounts  of data. 
Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data,

a  strange  approach  in  literary  studies.  Moretti focuses  on  the  analysis  of  novels,  plots, 
titles, whereas, we study the critical bibliography about literary works, in order to analyze 
the field. 

Again, we meet Moretti’s aim at studying Europe. As he establishes: 

Where  does  the  European  novel  begin?  Who  knows,  who  cares?  But  when  it 
managed to survive and to grow, this is relevant, and this we know: in Europe. In 
the  European  archipelago:  a  space  discontinuous  enough  to  allow  the 
simultaneous exploration of widely different paths. (p. 18) 

Once more, we differ from him, since, in this paper, our purpose is to map the 48 
national 
literatures  of  Europe,  through  the  exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the 
bibliographic references contained in the main literary database, the Modern  Language 
Association International Bibliography, from now on MLAIB.Then, the series obtained are 
correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and 
how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. Thus, we believe 
that our methods and aims fairly complement Moretti’s. 

 

Theory and methodology 

From the theoretical viewpoint, this  project stands at the crossroad of several  notions: 
the  concept  of  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge 
domain  analysis  (Albrechtsen  1997;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995;  Hjorland  2001; 
Nascimento  &  Marteleto  2008),  scientometrics  (Price  1963;  Garfield  1980,  2005; 
Leydesdorff  1998),  and  big  data  (Boyd  & Crawford  2012;  Cukier  &  Mayer-Schoenberger 
2013; Mayer-Schönberger& Cukier 2013). 

According  to  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  society  can  be  defined  as  the 
intertwining  of fields: economic, political, religious, cultural, etc. Each field is organized 
according to its own logic that corresponds to the issues that characterize it. Thus, within 
a field, the interactions between the agents are structured according to their resources: 
economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital. 

In  their  research  about  the  disciplinary  field  of  architecture,  Nascimento  and 
Marteleto  (2008)  reinforced  the  relations  between  the  concept  of  knowledge  domain 
analysis  –developed  by  Hjørland  and  Albrechtsen  (1995),  Albrechtsen  (1997),  and 
Hjørland (2001)– and Bourdieu’s field concept. Particularly, the authors state that: 

it becomes possible to understand how and why informational practice (as social 
practice)  is  constituted  within  a  domain  of  knowledge,  and,  above  all,  interpret 
the  historical,  cultural,  and  social  dimensions  that  influence  the  construction  of 
information. (Nascimento & Marteleto, 2008, p. 402) 

Methodologically,  aiming  at  identifying  the  European  national  literatures  in 
quantitative terms, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price 
(1963),  the  purpose  of  scientometrics  is  to  measure  and  to  analyze  the  scientific  and 
technological  activity.  Its  development  is  due  to  the  foundation  of  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  by  Eugene  Garfield,  nowadays 
internationally  renowned  as 
Thomson  ISI.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and 
features of the abovementioned MLAIB. This electronic bibliography, the most important 

5  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 
one  in  literary  studies,  contains  over  2,200,000  references  and  includes  approximately 
4,400  journals.  Besides  the  articles,  the  MLAIB  database  includes  references  to  books, 
book chapters and theses (Fitz-Enz, 2008). In terms of chronology, it covers the literary 
critique from 1851 to the present. 

Through the techniques of data mining (Han et al., 2012; Witten et al., 2011), and 
keywords (Callon &Penan, 1993), we initially obtain a sample of the critical bibliography 
about each European national literature. Then, we extract the literary corpus as well as a 
list of the main writers for each country. This allows us tovisualize the importance of each 
of  the48  European  national  literatures  and  to  obtain  a  map  of  the  continental  literary 
field.  

Moreover,  in  order  to  identify  the  tendencies  of  these  indicators,  we  correlate 
them  to  economic  and  development  indicators:  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the 
Human Development Index elaborated by the United Nations. Our purpose, at this stage, 
is  to  observe  whether  and  how  the  different  fields  –cultural,  economic,  and  social– 
interact with each other. 

As  abovementioned,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012)  established  that  big  data  is  «a 
cultural,  technological,  and  scholarly  phenomenon»  (p.  663).  Given  the  actual 
computational capacity of retrieving and storing massive volumes of data, it is possible to 
identify  the  existence  of  patterns  and  to  correlate  different  series.  In  this  sense,  the 
elaboration  of  bibliometric  indicators  for  the  48  European  national  literatures  is  an 
unprecedented  compilation  of  information  about  the  literary  field.We  aim  at  showing 
that  this  field  does  not  stand  alone,  but  is  intertwined  with  other  fields  as  Bourdieu 
points out.

Figure 3. Critical Bibliography 

 

The European literary field 

The  total set obtained for European literature contains 1,166,392 references, covering a 
period of 163 years, from1851 until 2014. Figure 3 represents the number of references for

each  of  the  48  national  literatures,  in  thousands  of  references.  As  we  can  observe,  7 
countries  clearly  stand out:  United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Italy,  Russia,  and 
Ireland.    Each  of  these  national  literatures  has  over  50,000  cumulated  critical  literary 
references. 

Figure 4 shows the number of authors that have been the object of at least 100 
publications. United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy have more than 100 writers in 
this situation. 

In terms of the number of works that have 100 or more references, Figure 5, only 2 

countries pass the bar of 100 titles: United Kingdom and France.

7  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Now,  if  we  consider  Table  1,  we  observe  that  only  17  countries  individually 
represent  more  than  0.5%  of  European  literature.  In  fact,  the  first  5  countries  –United 
Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  and  Italy–  cumulate  78%  of  the  critical  bibliography 
about  European  literature.  Altogether,  those  countries  with  less  than  0.5%  of  the 
references  represent less  than  3.4%  of  the  total  bibliography. This  data  shows  that  the 
critical  bibliography  about  this  literary  field  has  evolved  very  differently  across  the 
continent.  On  the  one  hand,  there  are  some  extremely  developed  critical  national 
systems, such as the  abovementioned top 7 countries. On the  other  hand, 31 countries 
cumulate  less  than  7,000  critical  references,  showing  an  embryonic  state  of  either  the 
literature  or  the  critical  apparatus  about  it.  Between  these  two  extremes,  we  find  10 
considerably  developed  national 
literatures,  whose  number  of  references  ranges 
between 7,000 and 17,000 publications.

Cultural, economic, and social indicators 

If we now turn to socio-economic indexes, there are several indicators calculated by the 
United  Nations  (United  Nations  Statistics  Division  and  United  Nations  Development 
Programme)that  we  may  want  to  consider.  Firstly,  we  can  observe,  Figure  6,  that  9 
countries have populations, in millions of inhabitants, well above the European average 
of  17  million  people.  In  fact,  3  countries  clearly  lead  in  terms  of  population:  Russia, 
Germany and Turkey.

Figure 7. Gross National Income 

In  terms  of  Gross  National  Income,  expressed  in  millions  of  2012  US$,  Figure  7, 
Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Russia stand out as the leaders. However, if 
we consider the Gross National Income per capita, the cartography is very different. In 
this  case,  Liechtenstein,  Norway,  and  Luxembourg  emerge  as  the  countries  with  the 
highest per capita income. 

Finally,  Figure  8  represents  the  values  of  the  Human  Development  Index.  This 
indicator  ranges  from  0  to  1  and  is  a:  «way  of  measuring  development  by  combining 
indicators  of  life  expectancy,  educational  attainment  and  income»  (UNDP).Norway  has 
the highest HDI, 0.955, whereas  the Republic of Moldova holds the lowest one, 0.660. 
This index is not calculated for every  country; thus, there is no indicator for Greenland, 
Kosovo, Monaco, and San Marino.

Indicators and Literature  

All along, we have been collecting data in order to answer basically one question: is there 
a  relation  between  a  country’s  cultural,  economic,  and  social  development  and  the 
importance of its national literature, measured through the critical bibliography? 

In order to answer it, we calculated several correlation coefficients. Table 2 shows 
the  results  of  these  correlations.  As  we  can  observe,  there  is  an  important  positive 
correlation  between  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the  number  of  authors  with  100 
references or more, 0.85, as well as between the Gross National Income and the number 
of references, 0.84. Also, there is a light positive correlation between the Gross National 
Income and the number of works with 100 references or more, 0.71, as well as between 
the  population  and  the  number  of  authors  with  100  references  or  more,  0.62,  and 
between  the  population  and  the  number  of  references,  0.60.  All  the  other  coefficients 
are inferior to 0.50, thus, showing no relation between the indicators.

We  could  then  say  that  the  level  of  evolution  of  the  critical  bibliography  about 
European  literatures  is  closely  and  positively  related  to  the  global  level  of  income  of 
these countries. 

 

Concluding remarks 

Through  the  exploration  and  analysis  of  the  MLAIB  references,  we  have  been  able  to 
map  the  profile  of  the  48  European  national  literatures,  in  terms  of  the  number  of 
references,  and  the  most  studied  writers  and  works.  We  have  seen  that  the  relative 
importance of the countries varies enormously, since some nations occupy a prominent 
place in the continental literary field, whereas others are at an embryonic state. Almost 
the  same  situation  is  observed  in  terms  of  the Gross  National  Income:  a  few  countries 
concentrate a high percentage of the continental yearly income. Again, we observe very 
dissimilar population indicators. However, if we consider the Human Development Index, 
the spread is not so large, ranging from 0.660 to 0.955. 

The  most 

interesting  results  arise  from  the  calculation  of  the  correlation 
coefficients  between  literary  and  socio-economic  indicators.  Actually,  we  were  able  to 
determine  that  there  is  an  important  correlation  between  the level  of  development  of 
the critical bibliography about national literatures and the Gross National Income of the 
European  countries.  Thus,  we  have  put  to  a  test  Bourdieu’s  assertion  about  the 
intertwining  of  the  social,  economic  and  cultural  fields.  Essentially,  we  have  confirmed 
that,  in  the  case  of  the  European  literary  field,  there  is  a  direct  and  positive  relation 
between  the  global  yearly  income  of  a  country  and  the  level  of  development  of  the 
critical activity about its literature. 

Finally,  we  believe  that  this  study  is  a  demonstration  of  the  relevance  of 
introducing  quantitative  methods  in  literary  studies.  Obviously,  this  new  approach  is  a 
direct  result  of  the  recent  convergence  of  informatics  and  the  humanities,  usually 
referred  to  as  digital  humanities,  and  the  availability  of  big  data,  another  recently 
developed concept.

Mapping European Literatures in the 21st Century

Abstract 

The  purpose  of  this  research  is,  firstly,  to  map  the  48  national  literatures  of  Europe,  through  the 
exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  contained  in  the  main  literary  database,  the 
Modern  Language Association International Bibliography.  Secondly, the series  obtained are correlated  to 
economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and 
social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands  at the crossroad 
of  several  concepts:  the  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge  domain 
analysis (Hjørland& Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 
1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; 
Boyd  &  Crawford  2012;  Mayer-Schönberger&  Cukier  2013).  Methodologically,  aiming  at  quantitatively 
identifying the  European  national literatures, we base  our research  on  scientometrics.  Initially developed 
by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological 
activity.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and  features  of  the  Modern 
Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 
1980,  2005;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995)  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  number  of  bibliographic  references 
dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize 
the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators.

Digital humanities and big data 

In  «A  genealogy  of  digital  humanities»,  MarijaDalbello  (2011)  proposesa  definition  of 
digital humanities: 

the  ability  to  read  the  archive  of  core  texts,  together  with  their  residual 
materiality from previous media contexts in order to produce intensive modes of 
engagement  with  particular  documents,  groups  of  texts,  and  the  archive  is 
brought to broader audiences. (Dalbello, 2011, p. 497) 

The  following  year,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012),  define  Big  Data  «as  a  cultural, 
technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology […], 
analysis  […],  mythology»  (Boyd  &  Crawford,  2012,  p.  663).  The  technological  aspect 
corresponds to the capacity of extracting, storing, and putting in relation immense sets 
of  information.  Analytically,  these  massive  amounts  of  information  make  it  possible  to 
identify  patterns  that  allow  us  to  obtain  economic,  social,  and  technical  conclusions 
about the behaviour of the series. The authors consider that the belief that big datasets 
represent superior knowledge capable of yielding truthful, objective, and exact results is 
only a mythology.

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

In 2013, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger (2013) establish that the phenomenon of 
massive  information  implies  a  change  in  the  way  we  consider  data.  Firstly,  we  can  no 
longer  consider  a  sample  of  data,  since  huge  amounts  of  data  are  available.  However, 
this  considerable  amount  of  information  implies  a  certain  uncleanness  of  information. 
Thus, this change means, secondly, that we have to accept the existence of some inexact 
data, an amount that is meaningless given the quantity of information available. Finally, 
frequently,  this  data  does  not  allow  us  to  know  the  causes  of  the  phenomena 
considered, allowing us only to correlate the series. Thus, there is a displacement from 
the determination of the causes of the events observed to their descriptions: instead of 
explaining the past, the correlations are used to predict the future. Moreover, as Berman 
(2013) points out: «Big Data provides quantitative methods to describe relationships, but 
these  descriptions  must  be  transformed  into  experimentally  verified  explanations»  (p. 
226). In this analysis, we will base our explanation on Bourdieu’s study of the behaviour 
of the literary field (1992). 

Once  the  definitions  of  digital  humanities  and  big  data  established,  we  should 
examine if there is a relation between these concepts. Thus, we have extracted from the 
ISI Web of Knowledge the references that correspond to these concepts. 

Figure 1 represents both series obtained from ISI Web of Knowledge by using the 
keyword technique (Callon &Penan, 1983) with the expressions “digital humanities” and 
“big data” in the title, for all disciplines. We observe that both series begin in the 2000s, 
with  the  exception  of  one  publication  about  big  data  published  in  1974.  However,  the 
publications about big data show a very significant growth since 2012.

Figure 1. Digital Humanities and Big Data - All Disciplines 

If  we only consider the  social  sciences, the humanities, and the  arts from the ISI 
Web of Knowledge database, Figure 2, we can see that the number of documents with 
these  terms  in  the  title  is  significantly  smaller.  These  series  also  begin  around  2000. 
However,  the digital  humanities  series begins  to  grow  in  2008. Thus,  the  gap  between 
the publications about both concepts is smaller. 

3  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Moreover,  according  to  the  ISI  Web  of  knowledge  database,  those  documents 
that refer to the digital humanities belong essentially to literature (39%), library science 
(22%),and 
linguistics  (18%).  In  contradistinction,  the  publications  about  big  data 
correspond to business economics (25%) and to library sciences(21%). Finally, there is only 
one text that belongs to both series: a paper that compares quantitative and qualitative 
methods. 

Thus, we could argue that, although both concepts share the use of computing to 
analyze phenomena belonging to the social sciences, the humanities and the arts, they 
constitute different specialties. 

In  spite  of  these  observations,  since  2008,  we  have  been  working  on  research 
projects that belong, to a certain extent, to both of the abovementioned tendencies. As 
a matter of fact, on the one hand, our research makes use of computing in order to study 
the  behaviour  of  social  sciences,  humanities,  and  arts  issues, particularly, literature.  On 
the other hand, they  are  based on the extraction and analysis of vast amounts  of data. 
Thus, our research considers texts as a starting point, but uses quantitative methods in 
order to analyze the data.

Quantitative methods and the literary field 

 

In Distant Reading, Franco Moretti (2013) explains how he came to introduce quantitative 
methods to the analysis of novels:  

Evolution,  geography,  maps,  series,  diagrams  …  One  step lead  to  the  next;  one 
step  asked  for  the  next.  And  one  day I  realized  that  the  study  of  morphological 
evolution had itself morphed into the analysis of quantitative data. (p. 179) 

Although  the  techniques  that  we  use  are  different  from  those  deployed  by 
Moretti, we consider that our research has also become an analysis of quantitative data,

Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, V7N1, 2015 

a  strange  approach  in  literary  studies.  Moretti focuses  on  the  analysis  of  novels,  plots, 
titles, whereas, we study the critical bibliography about literary works, in order to analyze 
the field. 

Again, we meet Moretti’s aim at studying Europe. As he establishes: 

Where  does  the  European  novel  begin?  Who  knows,  who  cares?  But  when  it 
managed to survive and to grow, this is relevant, and this we know: in Europe. In 
the  European  archipelago:  a  space  discontinuous  enough  to  allow  the 
simultaneous exploration of widely different paths. (p. 18) 

Once more, we differ from him, since, in this paper, our purpose is to map the 48 
national 
literatures  of  Europe,  through  the  exploration  and  the  analysis  of  the 
bibliographic references contained in the main literary database, the Modern  Language 
Association International Bibliography, from now on MLAIB.Then, the series obtained are 
correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and 
how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. Thus, we believe 
that our methods and aims fairly complement Moretti’s. 

 

Theory and methodology 

From the theoretical viewpoint, this  project stands at the crossroad of several  notions: 
the  concept  of  literary  field  defined  by  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  knowledge 
domain  analysis  (Albrechtsen  1997;  Hjorland  &  Albrechtsen  1995;  Hjorland  2001; 
Nascimento  &  Marteleto  2008),  scientometrics  (Price  1963;  Garfield  1980,  2005; 
Leydesdorff  1998),  and  big  data  (Boyd  & Crawford  2012;  Cukier  &  Mayer-Schoenberger 
2013; Mayer-Schönberger& Cukier 2013). 

According  to  Pierre  Bourdieu  (1972,  1980,  1992),  society  can  be  defined  as  the 
intertwining  of fields: economic, political, religious, cultural, etc. Each field is organized 
according to its own logic that corresponds to the issues that characterize it. Thus, within 
a field, the interactions between the agents are structured according to their resources: 
economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital. 

In  their  research  about  the  disciplinary  field  of  architecture,  Nascimento  and 
Marteleto  (2008)  reinforced  the  relations  between  the  concept  of  knowledge  domain 
analysis  –developed  by  Hjørland  and  Albrechtsen  (1995),  Albrechtsen  (1997),  and 
Hjørland (2001)– and Bourdieu’s field concept. Particularly, the authors state that: 

it becomes possible to understand how and why informational practice (as social 
practice)  is  constituted  within  a  domain  of  knowledge,  and,  above  all,  interpret 
the  historical,  cultural,  and  social  dimensions  that  influence  the  construction  of 
information. (Nascimento & Marteleto, 2008, p. 402) 

Methodologically,  aiming  at  identifying  the  European  national  literatures  in 
quantitative terms, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price 
(1963),  the  purpose  of  scientometrics  is  to  measure  and  to  analyze  the  scientific  and 
technological  activity.  Its  development  is  due  to  the  foundation  of  the  Institute  for 
Scientific  Information  by  Eugene  Garfield,  nowadays 
internationally  renowned  as 
Thomson  ISI.  In  this  study,  we  adapt  scientometric  indicators  to  the  architecture  and 
features of the abovementioned MLAIB. This electronic bibliography, the most important 

5  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 
one  in  literary  studies,  contains  over  2,200,000  references  and  includes  approximately 
4,400  journals.  Besides  the  articles,  the  MLAIB  database  includes  references  to  books, 
book chapters and theses (Fitz-Enz, 2008). In terms of chronology, it covers the literary 
critique from 1851 to the present. 

Through the techniques of data mining (Han et al., 2012; Witten et al., 2011), and 
keywords (Callon &Penan, 1993), we initially obtain a sample of the critical bibliography 
about each European national literature. Then, we extract the literary corpus as well as a 
list of the main writers for each country. This allows us tovisualize the importance of each 
of  the48  European  national  literatures  and  to  obtain  a  map  of  the  continental  literary 
field.  

Moreover,  in  order  to  identify  the  tendencies  of  these  indicators,  we  correlate 
them  to  economic  and  development  indicators:  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the 
Human Development Index elaborated by the United Nations. Our purpose, at this stage, 
is  to  observe  whether  and  how  the  different  fields  –cultural,  economic,  and  social– 
interact with each other. 

As  abovementioned,  Boyd  and  Crawford  (2012)  established  that  big  data  is  «a 
cultural,  technological,  and  scholarly  phenomenon»  (p.  663).  Given  the  actual 
computational capacity of retrieving and storing massive volumes of data, it is possible to 
identify  the  existence  of  patterns  and  to  correlate  different  series.  In  this  sense,  the 
elaboration  of  bibliometric  indicators  for  the  48  European  national  literatures  is  an 
unprecedented  compilation  of  information  about  the  literary  field.We  aim  at  showing 
that  this  field  does  not  stand  alone,  but  is  intertwined  with  other  fields  as  Bourdieu 
points out.

Figure 3. Critical Bibliography 

 

The European literary field 

The  total set obtained for European literature contains 1,166,392 references, covering a 
period of 163 years, from1851 until 2014. Figure 3 represents the number of references for

each  of  the  48  national  literatures,  in  thousands  of  references.  As  we  can  observe,  7 
countries  clearly  stand out:  United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Italy,  Russia,  and 
Ireland.    Each  of  these  national  literatures  has  over  50,000  cumulated  critical  literary 
references. 

Figure 4 shows the number of authors that have been the object of at least 100 
publications. United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy have more than 100 writers in 
this situation. 

In terms of the number of works that have 100 or more references, Figure 5, only 2 

countries pass the bar of 100 titles: United Kingdom and France.

7  Digital Humanities, Big Data, and Literary Studies: Mapping European Literatures in 

the 21st Century 

 

Now,  if  we  consider  Table  1,  we  observe  that  only  17  countries  individually 
represent  more  than  0.5%  of  European  literature.  In  fact,  the  first  5  countries  –United 
Kingdom,  France,  Germany,  Spain,  and  Italy–  cumulate  78%  of  the  critical  bibliography 
about  European  literature.  Altogether,  those  countries  with  less  than  0.5%  of  the 
references  represent less  than  3.4%  of  the  total  bibliography. This  data  shows  that  the 
critical  bibliography  about  this  literary  field  has  evolved  very  differently  across  the 
continent.  On  the  one  hand,  there  are  some  extremely  developed  critical  national 
systems, such as the  abovementioned top 7 countries. On the  other  hand, 31 countries 
cumulate  less  than  7,000  critical  references,  showing  an  embryonic  state  of  either  the 
literature  or  the  critical  apparatus  about  it.  Between  these  two  extremes,  we  find  10 
considerably  developed  national 
literatures,  whose  number  of  references  ranges 
between 7,000 and 17,000 publications.

Cultural, economic, and social indicators 

If we now turn to socio-economic indexes, there are several indicators calculated by the 
United  Nations  (United  Nations  Statistics  Division  and  United  Nations  Development 
Programme)that  we  may  want  to  consider.  Firstly,  we  can  observe,  Figure  6,  that  9 
countries have populations, in millions of inhabitants, well above the European average 
of  17  million  people.  In  fact,  3  countries  clearly  lead  in  terms  of  population:  Russia, 
Germany and Turkey.

Figure 7. Gross National Income 

In  terms  of  Gross  National  Income,  expressed  in  millions  of  2012  US$,  Figure  7, 
Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Russia stand out as the leaders. However, if 
we consider the Gross National Income per capita, the cartography is very different. In 
this  case,  Liechtenstein,  Norway,  and  Luxembourg  emerge  as  the  countries  with  the 
highest per capita income. 

Finally,  Figure  8  represents  the  values  of  the  Human  Development  Index.  This 
indicator  ranges  from  0  to  1  and  is  a:  «way  of  measuring  development  by  combining 
indicators  of  life  expectancy,  educational  attainment  and  income»  (UNDP).Norway  has 
the highest HDI, 0.955, whereas  the Republic of Moldova holds the lowest one, 0.660. 
This index is not calculated for every  country; thus, there is no indicator for Greenland, 
Kosovo, Monaco, and San Marino.

Figure 8. Human Development Index 

 

Indicators and Literature  

All along, we have been collecting data in order to answer basically one question: is there 
a  relation  between  a  country’s  cultural,  economic,  and  social  development  and  the 
importance of its national literature, measured through the critical bibliography? 

In order to answer it, we calculated several correlation coefficients. Table 2 shows 
the  results  of  these  correlations.  As  we  can  observe,  there  is  an  important  positive 
correlation  between  the  Gross  National  Income  and  the  number  of  authors  with  100 
references or more, 0.85, as well as between the Gross National Income and the number 
of references, 0.84. Also, there is a light positive correlation between the Gross National 
Income and the number of works with 100 references or more, 0.71, as well as between 
the  population  and  the  number  of  authors  with  100  references  or  more,  0.62,  and 
between  the  population  and  the  number  of  references,  0.60.  All  the  other  coefficients 
are inferior to 0.50, thus, showing no relation between the indicators.

We  could  then  say  that  the  level  of  evolution  of  the  critical  bibliography  about 
European  literatures  is  closely  and  positively  related  to  the  global  level  of  income  of 
these countries. 

 

Concluding remarks 

Through  the  exploration  and  analysis  of  the  MLAIB  references,  we  have  been  able  to 
map  the  profile  of  the  48  European  national  literatures,  in  terms  of  the  number  of 
references,  and  the  most  studied  writers  and  works.  We  have  seen  that  the  relative 
importance of the countries varies enormously, since some nations occupy a prominent 
place in the continental literary field, whereas others are at an embryonic state. Almost 
the  same  situation  is  observed  in  terms  of  the Gross  National  Income:  a  few  countries 
concentrate a high percentage of the continental yearly income. Again, we observe very 
dissimilar population indicators. However, if we consider the Human Development Index, 
the spread is not so large, ranging from 0.660 to 0.955. 

The  most 

interesting  results  arise  from  the  calculation  of  the  correlation 
coefficients  between  literary  and  socio-economic  indicators.  Actually,  we  were  able  to 
determine  that  there  is  an  important  correlation  between  the level  of  development  of 
the critical bibliography about national literatures and the Gross National Income of the 
European  countries.  Thus,  we  have  put  to  a  test  Bourdieu’s  assertion  about  the 
intertwining  of  the  social,  economic  and  cultural  fields.  Essentially,  we  have  confirmed 
that,  in  the  case  of  the  European  literary  field,  there  is  a  direct  and  positive  relation 
between  the  global  yearly  income  of  a  country  and  the  level  of  development  of  the 
critical activity about its literature. 

Finally,  we  believe  that  this  study  is  a  demonstration  of  the  relevance  of 
introducing  quantitative  methods  in  literary  studies.  Obviously,  this  new  approach  is  a 
direct  result  of  the  recent  convergence  of  informatics  and  the  humanities,  usually 
referred  to  as  digital  humanities,  and  the  availability  of  big  data,  another  recently 
developed concept.
