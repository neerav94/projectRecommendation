This third time trail of newly-released MegaODA™ software studies 
the fastest-to-analyze application, known as a 2x2 cross-classification 
table. Designs involving unweighted binary data are arguably currently 
the most widely employed across quantitative scientific disciplines as 
well as engineering fields including communications, graphics, data 
compression, real-time processing and autonomous synthetic decision-
making, among others. The present simulation research is run on a 3 
GHz Intel Pentium D microcomputer and reveals MegaODA returns 
the exact one- or two-tailed Type I error rate, as well as all of the other 
classification-relevant statistics provided in UniODA analysis,  in 
fractions of a CPU second for samples of a million observations.  

 

The first time trial of MegaODA software1 used 
Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to ascertain that 
the software is capable of rapidly ruling-out ef-
fects that are not statistically significant (ns) for 
applications involving ordered attributes, or for 
categorical attributes having five response cate-
gories. Rule-in analysis of ordered attributes 
was assessed in a second time trial2, but hasn’t 
yet been reported for categorical attributes. Ac-
cordingly the present study presents initial time 
trials for rule-out and rule-in analysis conducted 
for the most common categorical design, the 
2x2 cross-classification table. In this study the 
special-purpose TABLE algorithm which is 
available in UniODA and MegaODA software, 
designed to maximize solution speed, is used to 
conduct the analyses, and MC simulation is not 
run because exact p is computed (ODA software 
randomization and Fisher’s exact test are iso-
morphic for binary applications).3

moderate (ESS=ESP= 40.0) effects3 for designs 
with n=100,000: multiply each tabled value by 
ten to get the data used for n=106. The following 
UniODA and MegaODA code3 was used to 
analyze these 2x2 tables (program commands 
are indicated in red).

All analyses involving large or BIG 

DATA samples, and weak or moderate effects, 
were completed in fractions of a CPU second: 
the use of 0 CPU seconds reported in software 
output indicates that less than half of a CPU 
second elapsed. Chaining 100 sequential runs of 
the largest problem and timing overall solution 
time via stopwatch suggested that each analysis 
required approximately 0.15 CPU seconds to 
initiate, run and complete. Development of a

special-purpose “pipeline” architecture and the 
use of other supercomputing methods4 would 
further enhance problem solution speed by more 
than an order of magnitude, should the need for 
such speed ever arise.
