coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10].

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback

of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise

essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have

algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the

optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.

that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants.

11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

The Planner’s Problem 
 
Definitions:  
 
Consider a city with N people defined as a connected social network [57]. This means 
that every person in the city can be connected to any other through a series of social links 
between third parties, however long.  The social network that characterizes the city is G, 
which is made up of K social links. Both the general structure of G and its size K are  
functions of N and of other urban factors such as the costs (e.g. transportation, crime, 
time) and benefits (wages, information) of social interaction in that city.  
 
The city’s “performance” is monitored in terms of a set of quantities Y1,Y2,...,YM. These 
urban metrics may vary from case to case but I simply require that they are measurable 
quantitatively. The important property of eachYi  is that it is a function of the city’s social 
configuration, that is Yi(G). The metrics Yi  can measure familiar things, such as the size 
of city’s economy (GDP), the state of its public health, urban crime rates, the cost of 
transportation,  indices  of  environmental  sustainability,  etc,  including  more  subjective 
quantities such as happiness, or satisfaction. I show below that what is measured and how 
many indicators are considered is not substantially important. The defining property is 
that they are functions of the social networks that make up the city, G. 
 
Problem Statement: 
 
Given these definitions, the Planner’s Problem is to choose the plan associated with the 
best G, subject on K remaining constant, so that a suitable function of the city’s metrics 
Yi  is maximized.  
 
Sketch of proof: 
 
The Planner’s Problem is computationally intractable: 
 
Without  more  specific  knowledge,  consider  a  city  of  N people  characterized  by  all 
possibilities for social connections between them,  KP. For example, in the simplest case 
that these are undirected links we have  KP = N(N −1)/2. Within this space the planner

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

The Planner’s Problem 
 
Definitions:  
 
Consider a city with N people defined as a connected social network [57]. This means 
that every person in the city can be connected to any other through a series of social links 
between third parties, however long.  The social network that characterizes the city is G, 
which is made up of K social links. Both the general structure of G and its size K are  
functions of N and of other urban factors such as the costs (e.g. transportation, crime, 
time) and benefits (wages, information) of social interaction in that city.  
 
The city’s “performance” is monitored in terms of a set of quantities Y1,Y2,...,YM. These 
urban metrics may vary from case to case but I simply require that they are measurable 
quantitatively. The important property of eachYi  is that it is a function of the city’s social 
configuration, that is Yi(G). The metrics Yi  can measure familiar things, such as the size 
of city’s economy (GDP), the state of its public health, urban crime rates, the cost of 
transportation,  indices  of  environmental  sustainability,  etc,  including  more  subjective 
quantities such as happiness, or satisfaction. I show below that what is measured and how 
many indicators are considered is not substantially important. The defining property is 
that they are functions of the social networks that make up the city, G. 
 
Problem Statement: 
 
Given these definitions, the Planner’s Problem is to choose the plan associated with the 
best G, subject on K remaining constant, so that a suitable function of the city’s metrics 
Yi  is maximized.  
 
Sketch of proof: 
 
The Planner’s Problem is computationally intractable: 
 
Without  more  specific  knowledge,  consider  a  city  of  N people  characterized  by  all 
possibilities for social connections between them,  KP. For example, in the simplest case 
that these are undirected links we have  KP = N(N −1)/2. Within this space the planner 

18	  

	  

needs to determine the plan that assigns K connections optimally. The number of plans, 
P, therefore is given by the number of combinations of K in  KP [67] or  
 

K p!

P(KP,K) =
 

K!(K p −K)! = elnK p!−lnK!−ln(K p−K )! ≡ eB(K p,K ).                         (S1) 

 
For large KP, K I can use Stirling’s approximation to the factorial 
 
 
in the exponent B(KP,K). After some algebra I obtain, 
 
 K ln KP
K

B(KP,K)  K ln KP
K

⎟⎟⎟.                                          (S3)

Now, urban scaling theory [58] and cell phone data [68], tell us that   K = K0N1+δ, where 
1
K0is  a  constant  of  order  a  few  connections,  and 
6.  The  number  of  potential 
connections may vary somewhat depending on additional constraints on the problem, but 
the simplest assumption, given above, is that  KP ~ N 2 (Metcalfe’s Law).  
 
Thus, with these choices I obtain, 
 

δ 
  

   B(N)  B0N1+δ ln N.                                                      (S4) 

 
Then, the number of plans that need to be evaluated to make the best choice is  
 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,                                                      (S5) 
 
which grows faster than exponentially with the number of people in the city. This is an 
astronomical number, for example, for a million people N =106 , I obtain 
 

 P(N) = P0e1.4×107

= P0106×106 ,                                             (S6) 

 
much, much larger than all the atoms in the universe (~1082). 
 
The  number  of  computational  steps  needed  to  evaluate  the  best  plan  is  set  by  the 
evaluation of the quantities Yi for each plan. Regardless of details, this can be done in ~
 M ×P   steps,  plus  the  sorting  of  these  plans  by  these  values.  The  fastest  sorting 
algorithms  require  at  least  P  steps  ( PlogP is  more  typical),  so  I  conclude  that  the 
complete  algorithm  would  have  a  computational  complexity  proportional  to  at  least

Abstract: 
There  is  much  enthusiasm  currently  about  the  possibilities  created  by  new  and  more 
extensive sources of data to better understand and manage cities.  Here, I explore how big 
data can be useful in urban planning by formalizing the planning process as a general 
computational  problem.  I  show  that,  under  general  conditions,  new  sources  of  data 
coordinated  with  urban  policy  can  be  applied  following  fundamental  principles  of 
engineering to achieve new solutions to important age-old urban problems.  I also show, 
that  comprehensive  urban  planning  is  computationally  intractable  (i.e.  practically 
impossible)  in  large  cities,  regardless  of  the  amounts  of  data  available.  This  dilemma 
between the need for planning and coordination and its impossibility in detail is resolved 
by  the  recognition  that  cities  are  first  and  foremost  self-organizing  social  networks 
embedded in space and enabled by urban infrastructure and services. As such the primary 
role of big data in cities is to facilitate information flows and mechanisms of learning and 
coordination by heterogeneous individuals. However, processes of self-organization in 
cities, as well as of service improvement and expansion, must rely on general principles 
that enforce necessary conditions for cities to operate and evolve. Such ideas are the core 
a developing scientific theory of cities, which is itself enabled by the growing availability 
of quantitative data on thousands of cities worldwide, across different geographies and 
levels of development. These three uses of data and information technologies in cities 
constitute then the necessary pillars for more successful urban policy and management 
that  encourages,  and  does  not  stifle,  the  fundamental  role  of  cities  as  engines  of 
development and innovation in human societies.

1. New Opportunities for the Use of Big Data in Cites 
 
How does one measure a city? By the buildings that fill its skyline? By the efficiency of its rapid 
transit? Or, perhaps, by what Jane Jacobs called the “sidewalk ballet” of a busy street?   Certainly 
these are the memorable hallmarks of any modern city or metropolitan area. But a city’s true 
measure goes beyond human-made structures and lies deeper than daily routine. Rather, cities and 
metro areas are defined by the quality of the ideas they generate, the innovations they spur, and 
the opportunities they create for the people living within and outside the city limits.  - Judith 
Rodin, 2013 [1]. 
 
The rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) [2,3] and the spread of 
urbanization  [4]  are  arguable  the  two  most  important  global  trends  at  play  across  the 
world today.  Both are unprecedented in their scope and magnitude in history, and both 
will  likely  change  the  way  we  live  irreversibly.  If  current  trends  continue,  we  may 
reasonably expect that the vast majority of people everywhere in the world will live in 
urban environments within just a few decades and that information technologies will be 
part of their daily lives, embedded in their dwellings, communications, transportation and 
other urban services.  
 
It  is  therefore  an  obvious  opportunity  to  use  such  technologies  to  better  understand 
urbanism  as  away  of  life  [5,6],  and  to  improve  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  many 
challenges that urban development entails in both developed and developing cities [4,7].   
 
Despite its general appeal, the fundamental opportunities and challenges of using big data 
in cities have, in my opinion, not been sufficiently formalized. In particular, the necessary 
conditions for the general strategic application of big data in cities need to be spelled out 
and  their  limitations  must  also  be,  as  much  as  possible,  anticipated  and  clarified.  To 
address these questions in light of the current interdisciplinary knowledge of cities is the 
main objective of this perspective1. 
 
Before  I  start,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  use  of  quantitative  data  to  better 
understand urban problems and to guide their solutions is not at all new.  In the United 
States – and in New York City in particular – we have been building detailed statistical 
pictures of urban issues for over a century. Jacob Riis’ influential “How the other half 
lives” [11] derived much of its persuasive power from the use of statistics, e.g. by giving 
numbers  of  deaths  in  tenements  in  New  York  City  to  the  person.    The  NYC-RAND 
Institute  in  the  1970s  [12]  used  detailed  urban  statistics,  modeling  and  computation 
developed  for  wartime  and  corporate  management  to  determine  resource  allocation, 
especially  for  New  York  City’s  Fire  Department  [13].  Thus,  today’s  Smart  Cities 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
1	  In this paper I do not discuss issues of ethics or privacy related to big data, nor of the political or 

corporate potential pitfalls of using big data to manage cities. This is not because these issues are 
not important but because here I wish to focus on the fundamental possibilities to manage cities 
based on data, without such complications. It can probably be said that any of these 
considerations will work to limit the scope and effectiveness of the use of data to address urban 
issues and will, as a consequence, make the case for its use less compelling. Several authors have 
recently written eloquently about several of these issues  [8,9,10]. 

	  

	  

movement  [14-28]  needs  to  be  placed  in  perspective:  Are  the  achievements  made 
possible by modern data and information technologies fundamentally different from what 
was possible in the past? Or are they the extensions of old ideas and procedures, albeit 
with greater scope and precision?   
 
To answer these questions I formalize the use of data in urban policy and management in 
light of the conceptual frameworks of engineering [29]. I show, in the next section, that 
this allows us to identify the necessary conditions for the effective use of data and policy 
to address a large array of urban issues. In this way I will demonstrate that, in principle at 
least,  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  are  opening  entirely  new 
windows of opportunity for the application of engineering solutions to cities. 
 
But the problems of cities are always primarily about people.  Social and economic issues 
in  cities  define  what  planners  call  ‘wicked  problems’  [30],  a  term  that  has  gained 
currency in policy analysis well beyond the urban context. These are the kind of issues 
that are not expected to yield to engineering solutions, for specific reasons [30] that break 
the  assumptions  of  feedback  control  theory  [29].    In  section  3  I  revisit  the  issue  of 
‘wicked problem’ in light of computational complexity theory [31] to make the formal 
argument that detailed urban planning is computationally intractable.  This means that 
solutions requiring the knowledge and forecast of chains of detailed behaviors in cities 
have the fundamental property that they become practically impossible in large cities, 
regardless  of  the  size  of  data  available.    This  clarifies  the  central  dilemma  of  urban 
planning and policy: that planning is clearly necessary to address long-term issues that 
span the city, e.g. in terms of services and infrastructure, and yet that the effects of such 
plans are impossible to evaluate a priori in detail. 
 
In Section 4 I resolve this dilemma. The key is the nature of self-organization of social 
and economic life in cities and the development of a general quantitative understanding 
of  how  such  processes  operate  in  cities  as  vast  networks,  spanning  large  spatial  and 
temporal scales. Theory recognizes that most individual details are irrelevant to describe 
complex  systems  as  a  whole,  while  identifying  crucial  general  dynamics  [32].  For 
example, a city exists and functions even as people change their place of residence, jobs 
and  friendships.    The  development  of  this  kind  of  urban  theory  too  follows  from 
increasing data availability in many cities around the world, both in terms of observations 
and, wherever possible, from experiments.   
 
I then discuss how the increasing integration of limited-scope engineering solutions with 
the dynamics of social self-organization in cities, articulated by the long and large views 
afforded  by  urban  theory  provide  the  appropriate  context  to  understand  and  manage 
cities,  while  allowing  them  to  play  their  primary  function  in  human  societies  of 
continuing to evolve socially and economically in open-ended ways.

2. The Nature of Big Data Solutions in Cities 
 
It is a profoundly erroneous truism […] that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are 
doing.      The  precise  opposite  is  the  case.  Civilization  advances  by  extending  the  number  of 
important operations, which we can perform without thinking about them.  
- Alfred Whitehead, 1911 [33]. 
 
Relatively  simple-minded  solutions,  enabled  by  precise  measurements  and  prompt 
responses,  can  sometimes  operate  wonders  even  in  seemingly  very  complex  systems 
where traditional policies or technologies have failed in the past.  
 
An  example,  not  immediately  related  to  managing  cities,  illustrates  this  point:  self-
driving cars. I have recently attended a workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
Physics  in  Santa  Barbara,  CA,  as  part  of  a  group  of  interdisciplinary  researchers 
discussing issues of artificial intelligence, algorithms and their relation to neuroscience. 
In a particularly memorable lecture, Prof. Richard Murray from Caltech2 explained how 
his team engineered a self-driving vehicle that completed DARPA’s Grand Challenge in 
2005 [34] and was now deploying it on the road in cities3.  Richard described the array of 
diverse sensors for determining surrounding objects and their speed, for geo-locating the 
vehicle,  recognizing  the  road  and  its  boundaries  and  planning  its  path.    I  interjected 
asking whether the vehicle learned from its experience and, to my surprise, the response 
was  no:  it  was  all  “hardwired”  by  the  team  at  Caltech,  using  principles  of  feedback 
control theory.  I protested that surely the hardest problem faced by a self-driving car was 
not planning its path, recognizing the road or measuring surrounding traffic – but all the 
stupid  things  that  people  do  on  the  road:  “Doesn’t  the  car  need  a  model  of  human 
behavior? That is surely the hard part!”   
 
The answer, surprisingly, is no, not at all!  The reason is that while people surely do 
reckless things behind the wheel, they do so, from the car’s perspective, at a truly glacial 
pace:  While  humans  behave  unpredictably  on  the  time  scale  of  seconds,  the  car’s 
electronics and actuators respond in milliseconds or faster. In practice, this allows the car 
more than enough time to take very basic ‘hardwired’ evasive actions, such as breaking 
or getting out of the way. In fact, presently self-driving cars have a safety record that 
exceeds that of humans [35,36]. 
 
The  lesson  from  this  story  is  that  relatively  simple  solutions  that  require  no  great 
intelligence can, under specific conditions, solve very hard problems. The key is fast and 
precise enough measurement and adequate simple reactions. In other words, sometimes 
you don’t need to be very smart if you are fast enough.  

2 This paragraph is based on my personal recollection of Richard Murray’s lecture. Any 
inaccuracies or embellishments are mine not the speaker’s. 
3 Self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles (most famously developed by Sebastian Thrun’s team 
from Stanford U., now at Google) are no longer news in urban environments. Google deploys a 
dozen cars on a typical day in the Bay Area [35].

This is the logic of modern engineering, and more precisely of feedback control theory 
[29].  If we know the desired operating point for a system (e.g. avoid collision) and we 
have the means to operate on the system, as we observe its state change, via feedback 
loops,  we  can  under  general  conditions  turn  it  into  a  simple  problem.  The  crucial 
conditions are to be able to measure and recognize potential problems just as they start to 
arise (car approaching) and act to make the necessary corrections (break or get out of the 
way,  thereby  avoiding  collision).  The  crucial  issue  is  that  of  temporal  scales;  every 
system has intrinsic timescales at which problems develop, a few seconds in the case of a 
car on the road. Cycles of measurement and reaction that avoid such complex problems 
by simple means must act well within this window of opportunity.  
 
We now see more clearly why a new generation of bigger data may offer radically novel 
solutions to difficult problems.  Modern electronics are now so fast in comparison to 
most  physical,  biological  and  social  phenomena  that  myriads  of  important  policy 
problems are falling within this window of opportunity.  In such circumstances, models 
of system response can be very simple and crude (they can typically be linearized) [29]. 
Thus, the engineering approach conveniently bypasses the complexities that always arise 
in these systems at longer temporal or larger spatial scales, such as the need to develop 
models of human behavior.  In this way a difficult and important problem can be solved 
essentially without theory [37].  This is the (potential) miracle of big data in cities.  
 
Most examples of urban management and policy in cities that use data successfully have 
this flavor, regardless of being implemented by people and organizations or by computer 
algorithms. Table 1 presents a summary of important urban issues, where I attempted to 
roughly  characterize  their  typical  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  nature  of  their 
operating points, or outcomes.   
 
For example, think of urban transportation systems, such as a bus network, in these terms 
[38]. Buses should carry passengers who wait a few minutes to be transported over a few 
kilometers. Measuring the time in between buses at each stop, possibly together with the 
number of passengers waiting, gives the planner the basis for a feedback control solution: 
Communicate with buses to enforce desired standards of service, quickly place more or 
fewer units in service where these parameters start to deviate from the ideal metrics, and 
the quality of service as measured by per person waiting times will improve. This type of 
strategy  can  be  operated  intuitively  by  human  dispatchers  but  possibly  can  also  be 
implemented by an ICT algorithm [38] with access to the necessary measurements and 
actions.    Feedback  control  theory  provides  the  framework  for  the  development  and 
optimization of any of these solutions.   
 
Similar procedures could be devised for water or power supply management and for their 
integration  with  public  transportation  systems  [39,40].  Traffic  management,  trash 
collection, infrastructure maintenance (building, roads, pipes, etc) could also generally be 
though of, and integrated together, in analogous ways.

Table  1.  Urban  issues,  their  temporal  and  spatial  scales  and  the  character  of  their  associated 
metrics. Outcome metrics are to be interpreted on the time scale in the table. On longer timescales 
socioeconomic issues, characterized by long times, become part of every problem. 
 
And there is no reason in principle why certain stubbornly difficult social problems, such 
as crime, may not be responsive to patrolling and other law enforcement strategies that 
follow similar principles. Crime is local and its outcomes clear enough. Exciting new 
experiments in several cities, notably in Los Angeles [41,42], suggest that much. 
 
Recent  insights  by  innovative  corporations  [43-46]  and  policy  strategists  [47]  have 
correctly anticipated that flows of information underpin such coordinated solutions. Thus, 
progress in these problems is fundamentally an ICT problem, enabled by simple actions 
or policies that correct the states of systems towards optimal performance.  
 
But other urban issues, especially those that are primarily social or economic acquire, as 
seen through this lens, a different character because their operating points are not well 
defined or because their dynamics are rather diffuse and play out over large temporal or 
spatial scales and are the result of large chains of social events, Table 1. Thus, it has 
remained  difficult  to  create  engineering  solutions  to  problems  of  education,  public 
housing4, economic development, poverty or sustainability at the city level.   

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
4	  Notably, public housing policy in places such as Hong Kong [48] or Singapore [49] has fared 
	  

uncharacteristically well when compared to western cities. These successes are likely due to a 
combination of an adaptable design, where apartments can be expanded as households become 

6	  

 
Public  health  issues  often  sit  at  an  intermediate  level  of  complexity.  Analogously  to 
crime, contagious diseases are characterized by simple metrics and by local processes of 
social  contact  between  individuals.  Thus,  containment  or  eradication  of  cholera  or  of 
contagious diseases for which vaccination exists, represent some of the greatest successes 
of urban policy5. But conditions that play out over longer times6 and may have more 
complex and diffuse social causation, such as chronic diseases or even HIV/AIDS have 
proven thus far more difficult. 
 
Thus, the simplicity of performance metrics expressed as objective quantitative quantities 
and knowledge of their proximate causes in space and time are the crucial conditions for 
successful engineering inspired solutions. The important point to always bear in mind, 
however, is that these quantities are relative to the properties of the controlling system – 
the  policy  maker  or  the  algorithm  –  such  as  their  response  times,  so  that  with 
technological and scientific evolution we may hope to fulfill Alfred Whitehead’s maxim 
quoted  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  of  achieving  progress  through  the  increasing 
automation of solutions to once intractable problems7. 
 
3. The Planner’s Problem 
 
In  order  to  describe  a  wicked-problem  in  sufficient  detail,  one  has  to  develop  an  exhaustive 
inventory of all conceivable solutions ahead of time. The reason is that every question asking for 
additional information depends upon the understanding of the problem-- and its resolution --at 
that time. […] Therefore, in order to anticipate all questions (in order to anticipate all information 
required for resolution ahead of time), knowledge of all conceivable solutions is required.   
- Rittel and Webber, 1973 [30]. 
 
The scenarios developed in the previous section paint a well-defined path for the use of 
data  in  cities,  at  odds  with  many  decades  of  urban  theory  and  practice.  While  many 
physical  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  cities  appear  at  first  sight  manageable  through 
engineering practices, many social and economic issues are in fact ‘wicked problems’ 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

	  

	  

more prosperous, careful matching between housing characteristics and socioeconomic household 
capacities and close monitoring of housing problems and prompt response, in terms of conflict 
resolution, maintenance and repair. 
5 Dealing with the problem of cholera, by John Snow in London in the 1840s-50s, constitutes one 
of the first examples of a statistical approach to public health, though one thoroughly based on 
“shoe-leather epidemiology” [50]. 
6 An exception to this argument is influenza. It is a ‘fast’ disease that has defied public health 
response times. Its symptoms are generic and it typically is a large-scale problem, affecting 20-
30% of a population over large spatial regions. 
7 The arrow of progress made possible by engineering and automation does not always run in the 
same direction. The self-driving car solution that motivated this section works only as long as 
most cars are driven by people. Once most cars are self-driven and share the same fast response 
times, new instabilities will develop.  A preview of such problems can be seen in stock markets 
today, where it has been estimated that maybe over 80% of trades are made by algorithms on 
ultrafast time-scales [51]. Often such algorithms act on news written by other ultrafast algorithms.

6 and  P0 is a constant, independent of N. For a city of a million people this is 
where 
 P(N) = P0106×106,  a truly astronomical number much, much larger than all the atoms in 
the Universe. Thus, the Planner’s Problem is practically impossible. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

8 For the largest city in the world, Tokyo with 35 million inhabitants, we could imagine sensing 
each individual and a corresponding number of places, including different infrastructure and 
services using, say, 100 million data streams, sampled at one byte each once a second (a faster 
rate may be desirable for some applications, slower in others). This results in information flows 
of the order of 109 bits per second (Gbps) that are already handled by Gigabit Internet and current 
generation computing. So while still daunting these numbers can already be handled using current 
technologies. 

[30].  Over  the  long  run  the  social  and  infrastructural  aspects  of  the  city  are  always 
entangled. 
 
Wicked problems were originally defined by two urban planners, Rittel and Webber, in 
1973 [30]. The essential character of wicked problems is that they cannot be solved in 
practice by a (central) planner.  I shall reformulate some of their arguments in modern 
form  in  what  I  like  to  call  the  “Planner’s  Problem”.  The  Planner’s  Problem  has  two 
distinct facets: i) the knowledge problem and ii) the calculation problem.  
 
The  knowledge  problem  refers  to  the  information  (ultimately  as  data)  that  a  planner 
would need to map and understand the current state of the system; the city in our case.  
While still implausible, it is not impossible to conceive information and communication 
technologies that would give a planner, sitting in a ‘situation room’, access to detailed 
information about every aspect of the infrastructure, services and social lives in a city.  
Privacy concerns aside, it is conceivable that the lives and physical infrastructure of a 
large city could be adequately sensed in several million places at fine temporal rates, 
producing  large  but  potentially  manageable  rates  of  information  flow  by  current 
technology standards8. In this way the knowledge problem is not a showstopper. 
 
The  calculation  problem,  however,  alluded  to  in  the  quote  at  the  beginning  of  this 
section, refers to the computational complexity to perform the actual task of planning, in 
terms of the number of steps necessary to evaluate all possible scenarios and choose the 
best possible course of action.  This problem is analogous to playing a complex game, 
like chess, but with millions of pieces, each following different rules of interaction with 
others, against millions of opponents, on a vast board.  It will therefore not surprise the 
reader  that  the  exhaustive  approach  of  evaluating  each  possible  scenario  in  a  city  is 
impractical as it involves the consideration of impossibly large spaces of possibilities.   
 
I formalize this statement in the form of a theorem, and provide mathematical details and 
the  sketch  of  a  proof  in  the  Appendix.  The  result  of  considering  the  combinatorial 
possibilities of a city is the creation and selection of the best detailed urban plan would 
require a computation involving O[P(N)] steps in a city with population size N, where 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,  

8	  

	  

 
I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  sketch  of  a  proof  given  in  the  Appendix  relies  on  the 
formulation  of  the  Planner’s  Problem  as  the  choice  of  the  best  spatial  and  social 
configuration  for  the  city  that  maximizes  asset  of  urban  metrics.  A  more  limited 
conceptualization of the problem will likely have lower computational complexity, but 
may not guarantee finding the best plan. In such a case, planning must rely on heuristics 
and cannot guarantee absolute optimality. 
 
Given  these  caveats,  I  have  shown  that  planning  the  city  in  detail  becomes 
computationally impossible in all but the smallest towns. This indicates that the use of 
complex models [39,53] in the detailed planning and management of cities has its limits 
and cannot be exhaustively mapped and solved in general, regardless of how much data a 
planner may acquire.  How then should we think of planning under these limitations, and 
what becomes the role of bigger and better data in cities? 
 
4. Self-organization, Information and the Role of a Science of Cities 
 
Provided that some groups on earth continue either muddling or revolutionizing themselves into 
periods of economic development, we can be absolutely sure of a few things about future cities.  
The cities will not be smaller, simpler or more specialized as cities of today.  Rather, they will be 
more  intricate,  comprehensive,  diversified  and  larger  than  today’s  and  will  have  even  more 
complicated jumbles of old and new things as ours do.  - Jane Jacobs, 1970 [54] 
 
Part of the answer to the Planner’s Problem comes from economics, where the social 
(central) planner faces a similar, if more limited, predicament of organizing economic 
markets. The detailed information necessary to run a city in terms of planning the lives of 
people and organizations is, of course, best know to those agents themselves. Even more 
importantly,  the  motivation  and  capacity  to  make  good  decisions  and  act  on  this 
information  resides  with  the  very  same  agents.    Thus,  cities  are  self-organizing  and 
depend crucially not on the detailed instructions from the planner’s ‘situation room’ but 
rather  on  the  integration  and  coordination  of  myriads  of  individual  decisions,  made 
possible by suitable information flows9.    
 
In this sense, cities have always been the primary creators and users of information and 
communication technologies, from the daily newspaper, to postal mail, to the telegraph or 
the  (cellular)  telephone  [57].    It  should  then  come  as  no  surprise  that  new  ICTs  will 
primarily act to enable cities, rather than compete with them. In fact, the problem that 
ICTs address in specific niches, is the general problem solved by cities [58]: That is, the 
integration and coordination of people and organizations through information sharing in 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9	  The original argument for self-organization in the context of economics was made e.g. by 
	  

Friedrich Hayek in the essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” [55], a title that the present 
manuscript echoes.  The central argument is that economies are primarily about information and 
that the price system of economics is one (good) way of achieving the necessary self-organization 
in terms of the allocations of goods and services, labor and capital.  This point is also emphasized 
by Paul Krugman in his 1992 Ohlin lectures [56].

vast  social  networks  that  can  confer  benefits  to  individual  agents  and  to  society  as  a 
whole.  
 
This  then  brings  us  to  another  perspective  on  the  use  of  big  data  in  cities,  radically 
different from the engineering framework of the previous sections. A vital function of 
information  and  communication  technologies  is  in  enabling  new  and  better  ways  for 
people  to  be  social.  In  this  respect  big  data  and  associated  technologies  play  only  a 
supportive role to social dynamics, not a prescriptive one. Data and technologies then do 
not create or solve urban problems so much as they enable people and social organization 
to address them better. This role of ICT has been discussed in the literature on smart 
cities [19,21,25,26]. Especially important is the potentially more rapid access to civic and 
economic participation of poor or excluded populations, particularly in developing cities 
and nations [59].  
 
The second part of the answer stems from the fact that bottom-up self-organization is 
clearly not enough for a well functioning city. Many developing cities, think of Mumbai 
[60], have self-organization in spades. Similarly, a flash-mob is as much the product of 
self-organization  as  a  new  art  form  or  a  new  business.  For  cities  to  work,  general 
properties  and  constraints  that  define  the  city  on  larger  scales  must  be  at  play.  Such 
features, common to all cities, are the focus of urban theory.  
 
Scientific  theory  is  not  about  the  details  of  a  particular  practical  problem;  it  is  about 
general principles that apply across many problem instances. Given how different cities 
are from each other and how much they change over time, to what extent can a scientific 
theory of cities be possible or useful?  
 
To illustrate this point consider another great triumph of science and engineering: the 
Moon shot.   It is not completely inconceivable that the Apollo 11 mission could have 
been pulled off in the absence of knowledge of the laws of mechanics and gravity. One 
could  imagine  controlling  rocket  thrusters  using  feedback  by  judging  whether  the 
spacecraft was leaving Earth, approaching the Moon at the right speed not to crash, etc. 
But of course this is not at all what happened: such solutions would be very difficult in 
terms of engineering and computation at the time, especially because of the fast time 
scales and large energies necessary for lift-off. Instead, we launch rockets based on their 
general  properties  as  prescribed  by  physical  theory,  the  mass  of  the  Earth  and  of  the 
spacecraft,  the  rotation  of  the  planet,  the  speed  necessary  at  lift-off,  etc.  This  set  of 
calculations gives a general strategy for launching any spacecraft from Earth and to place 
them in desired orbital positions.  
 
What  follows  this  general  solution  is  a  detailed,  but  much  more  limited,  use  of 
engineering principles and self-organization to fine-tune solutions to the details of the 
problem, such as the conditions for Moon landing given the particular spacecraft’s speed 
at that moment, its distance to the surface, the human operator past actions, etc.   
 
Thus, theory can enormously reduce the size of an engineering problem and in many 
cases makes solutions possible. In this way, urban theory sets the general parameters for 

10	  

	  

any city to work as a whole as a bottom-up self-organizing process mediated by social 
networks with certain general properties and enabled by infrastructure and services that 
follow general performance metrics [58]. The details of these processes must then be 
measured and managed, as appropriate, in every situation.  
 
The present state of urban theory is fast evolving and is starting to approach the status of 
an interdisciplinary science. New, bigger data that allows for the comparative quantitative 
analysis of thousands of cities worldwide has been the key in determining the general 
properties of cities and their variation due to both general conditions of development and 
local  histories  [58,61,62].    We  now  have  a  quantitative  framework  that  connects  the 
general  structure  of  cities  as  vast  social  networks,  to  their  general  properties  of 
infrastructure networks and land use [58]. In this way we are uncovering what kind of 
complex  system  cities  really  are  [6,58,63]  and  the  general  conditions  in  terms  of 
infrastructure,  energy  and  resource  use,  etc,  that  allow  cities  to  function  optimally  as 
distinct open-ended social systems, capable of socioeconomic growth and innovation in 
human societies10. 
 
5. Discussion 
 
The last great technological advancement that reshaped cities was the automobile (some might 
argue  it  was  the  elevator).  In  both  cases,  these  technologies  reshaped  the  physical  aspects  of 
living  in  cities  –  how  far  a  person  could  travel  or  how  high  a  building  could  climb.  But  the 
fundamentals of how cities worked remained the same. What’s different about the information 
age that has been ushered in by personal computers, mobile phones and the Internet is its ability 
to reshape the social organization of cities and empower everyday citizens with the knowledge 
and tools to actively participate in the policy, planning and management of cities.  
- Christian Madera, 2010 [66] 
 
Developed  cities  today  are  social  and  technical  complex  systems  characterized  by 
historically  unprecedented  levels  of  diversity  and  temporal  and  functional  integration. 
This growing individual specialization and interdependence makes large cities extremely 
diverse and crucially relies on fine temporal and spatial integration and on faster and 
more reliable information flows. These processes lie at the core of what makes cities the 
economic and cultural engines of all human societies.  
 
A  city  of  35  million  people,  like  present  day  Tokyo,  is  made  possible  by  extremely 
efficient  transportation,  reliable  energy  and  water  supply  and  good  social  services, 
including a very low level of conflict.  Many developing urban areas in the world today 
will have to replicate and improve upon these metrics if they are to fulfill their promise to 
become world cities and enable the pace of human development expected by millions of 
their inhabitants. 

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10	  While recent progress in urban theory has allowed us to better understand cities as multi-level 
	  
11	  

interacting networks and as processes of self-organization across scales, more work needs to be 
done regarding heterogeneous aspects of the city (inequality of incomes, variations across 
neighborhoods [64]) and the evolution of cities over time, including the processes of social 
development and economic growth [54,65].

I have showed here that the increasing separation of time-scales between information and 
communication technologies and the natural pace of human behavior will enable many 
fundamentally  new  engineered  solutions  that  may  solve  important  age-old  urban 
problems. Thus, new sensing, communications and computational technologies will play 
a vital role in enabling new urban scale efficiencies and city socioeconomic growth.  In 
this  sense  we  should  expect  that  with  urban  development,  services  and  infrastructure 
should  become  increasingly  engineered,  invisible,  predictable  and  automatic.  How 
resilience to infrastructure and service failures may be maintained in these circumstances 
is an important open problem.  Important as they are such solutions should always be 
understood to be short-term and to have a limited scope, as they must continue to adapt 
and enable socioeconomic development over the long run. 
 
The world’s most vibrant and attractive cities are not usually the same places where the 
buses run impeccably on time.  While improvements in infrastructure and urban services 
are absolutely necessary for cities to function better, they are not the fundamental sources 
of social development or economic growth. These, more fundamental functions of cities, 
rely on processes of social self-organization and on the fulfillment of general conditions 
that allow cities to operate effectively as multi-level open-ended evolving networks. It is, 
curiously,  this  more  fundamental  character  of  cities,  at  play  across  scales  from  the 
individual to the city as a whole and from seconds to centuries, that creates and solves the 
Planner’s Problem. 
 
In this light, the key to making cities even smarter, through new uses of information and 
communication technologies, is not very different from what it has always been. Big data 
creates more opportunities, not less, for cities to accentuate their urban character: The 
primary uses of big data in cities must then be to continue to enable the creation of new 
knowledge by more people, not replace it.

Appendix 
 
The Planner’s Problem 
 
Definitions:  
 
Consider a city with N people defined as a connected social network [57]. This means 
that every person in the city can be connected to any other through a series of social links 
between third parties, however long.  The social network that characterizes the city is G, 
which is made up of K social links. Both the general structure of G and its size K are  
functions of N and of other urban factors such as the costs (e.g. transportation, crime, 
time) and benefits (wages, information) of social interaction in that city.  
 
The city’s “performance” is monitored in terms of a set of quantities Y1,Y2,...,YM. These 
urban metrics may vary from case to case but I simply require that they are measurable 
quantitatively. The important property of eachYi  is that it is a function of the city’s social 
configuration, that is Yi(G). The metrics Yi  can measure familiar things, such as the size 
of city’s economy (GDP), the state of its public health, urban crime rates, the cost of 
transportation,  indices  of  environmental  sustainability,  etc,  including  more  subjective 
quantities such as happiness, or satisfaction. I show below that what is measured and how 
many indicators are considered is not substantially important. The defining property is 
that they are functions of the social networks that make up the city, G. 
 
Problem Statement: 
 
Given these definitions, the Planner’s Problem is to choose the plan associated with the 
best G, subject on K remaining constant, so that a suitable function of the city’s metrics 
Yi  is maximized.  
 
Sketch of proof: 
 
The Planner’s Problem is computationally intractable: 
 
Without  more  specific  knowledge,  consider  a  city  of  N people  characterized  by  all 
possibilities for social connections between them,  KP. For example, in the simplest case 
that these are undirected links we have  KP = N(N −1)/2. Within this space the planner 

18	  

	  

needs to determine the plan that assigns K connections optimally. The number of plans, 
P, therefore is given by the number of combinations of K in  KP [67] or  
 

K p!

P(KP,K) =
 

K!(K p −K)! = elnK p!−lnK!−ln(K p−K )! ≡ eB(K p,K ).                         (S1) 

 
For large KP, K I can use Stirling’s approximation to the factorial 
 
 
in the exponent B(KP,K). After some algebra I obtain, 
 
 K ln KP
K

B(KP,K)  K ln KP
K

⎞
⎟⎟⎟.                                          (S3) 
⎠

 
Now, urban scaling theory [58] and cell phone data [68], tell us that   K = K0N1+δ, where 
1
K0is  a  constant  of  order  a  few  connections,  and 
6.  The  number  of  potential 
connections may vary somewhat depending on additional constraints on the problem, but 
the simplest assumption, given above, is that  KP ~ N 2 (Metcalfe’s Law).  
 
Thus, with these choices I obtain, 
 

δ 
  

   B(N)  B0N1+δ ln N.                                                      (S4) 

 
Then, the number of plans that need to be evaluated to make the best choice is  
 

   P(N)  P0eN1+δ lnN,                                                      (S5) 
 
which grows faster than exponentially with the number of people in the city. This is an 
astronomical number, for example, for a million people N =106 , I obtain 
 

 P(N) = P0e1.4×107

= P0106×106 ,                                             (S6) 

 
much, much larger than all the atoms in the universe (~1082). 
 
The  number  of  computational  steps  needed  to  evaluate  the  best  plan  is  set  by  the 
evaluation of the quantities Yi for each plan. Regardless of details, this can be done in ~
 M ×P   steps,  plus  the  sorting  of  these  plans  by  these  values.  The  fastest  sorting 
algorithms  require  at  least  P  steps  ( PlogP is  more  typical),  so  I  conclude  that  the 
complete  algorithm  would  have  a  computational  complexity  proportional  to  at  least

19	  

	  

P(N). Such algorithm would scale with the population size of the city N, faster than 
exponentially and would be impractical in all but the smallest towns.  
 
Algorithms that scale exponentially or faster with the size of the input set are considered 
technically intractable, that is, they cannot be evaluated in practice as this set gets large. 
Thus,  the  (computational)  planner’s  problem,  under  the  present  set  of  assumptions,  is 
intractable.   
 
Notes: 
 
1.          The  detailed  combinatorial  arguments  involved  in  a  specific  algorithm  for  the 
Planner’s Problem are likely to be more constrained if we include considerations of time, 
budget,  etc.  This  may  result  in  effectively  a  smaller  number  of  potential  connections 
being  viable,  though  it  is  uncertain  whether  such  a  judgment  can  be  made  a  priori, 
without the consideration of all possibilities as done above. In any case note that the 
leading term in the exponent B is set by the number of social connection K in the city, not 
KP. As such, these considerations play a sub-leading role in the calculation.  
Given a number of urban indicators  M ≥ 3 there are well-known difficulties in 
2. 
producing an ordering of improvements that satisfies most inhabitants in the city. This is 
related to Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem [69]. Such problems arise in addition to the 
computational complexity of the Planner’s Problem. 
3. 
Decisions and actions by individuals and organizations based on information they 
obtain in their urban environments effectively solve the Planner’s Problem. They do so 
by  “parallelizing”  the  problem  and  its  inference  and  computations  through  the 
simultaneous pursuit of local adaptations that, in principle at least, can maximize each 
agent’s  preferences  under  constraints  (budgets,  knowledge,  time,  etc).  This  self-
organizing dynamics is not guaranteed to produce the best outcomes city-wide, though. A 
more formal argument for self-organization in cities and what it can and cannot achieve 
remains  an  open  problem  that  includes,  but  also  needs  to  transcend,  some  of  the 
foundational results in microeconomic theory.
