2.  RELATED WORK 

The  field  of  computational  social  science  or 
computational sustainability is a relatively young one, 
so  opportunities  for  new  applications  of  machine 
learning  abound.  Early  work  on  identifying  poverty 
using  remote  sensing  was  presented  in  2014  by  data 
scientists from DataKind working in conjunction with 
the NGO GiveDirectly. Their goal was to identify the 
poorest villages in western Kenya in order to deliver 
direct  cash  transfers  to  the  very  poor.  In  their 
approach,  they  used  template  matching  to  find  roofs 
in  satellite  images,  then  hand-designed  conventional 
computer vision features such as color histograms that 
would allow them to classify roofs as either metal or 
thatched [2, 3]. They then used the ratio of metal roofs 
in each village as a proxy for the amount of poverty 
present.

A more recent approach to poverty prediction was 
published 
few  weeks  ago. 
Blumenstock et al. used mobile phone call record data 
from  a  large  mobile  provider  in  Rwanda  to  predict 
asset-based  wealth  measures  nationwide  [4].  In 
addition to using survey data, they conducted a small-
scale phone survey to collect personalized wealth data 
specific to their call record dataset. For their poverty 
measure, they used a wealth index based on the first 
principal  component  of  the  data  collected  on  survey 
respondent asset ownership, a method summarized by 
Filmer and Pritchett in [5].  

This  project  is  a  continuation  of  work  in  Prof. 
Stefano  Ermon’s  group  in  the  Stanford  AI  Lab.  As 
described  earlier,  Xie  et  al.  [1]  trained  a  CNN  to 
predict  nighttime 
intensities  from  daytime 
satellite imagery, and then used the learned filters to 
predict poverty. However, they worked exclusively on 
the  problem  of  predicting  binary  poverty  labels 
(classifying  each  location  as  either  “in-poverty”  or 
“poverty-free”),  while  we  attempt 
to  predict 
continuous  measures  of  socioeconomic  status  in  this 
project. In going from a binary classification problem 
to  a  continuous  wealth  regression  problem,  we  hope 
to provide more useful and fine-grained poverty data 
for the World Bank and other entities on the ground in 
Africa. 
 
3.  DATASET AND FEATURES 

We  use  satellite  images  from  Google  Earth  [6] 
covering  all  of  Uganda  and  Tanzania  to  predict 
poverty  in  both  countries.  Our  Uganda  set  includes 
641  household  clusters,  where  each  cluster  contains 
around 10 households surveyed. Since up to 5 km of 
jitter  is  added  to  each  reported  cluster  location  to 

locations,  where  each 

preserve the anonymity of the survey respondents, we 
tile  each  location  with  100  images  of  1  km2  each  to 
cover  a  10  km  by  10  km  area.  Our  Tanzania  set

this  corresponds  to  a  resolution  of  approximately  3 
meters  per  pixel.  Some  examples  of  our  satellite 
images are shown in the first row of Figure 1.

World  Bank  and  collects  consumption  expenditure 
data  at  the  household  level  [7].  These  consumption 
expenditures represent the amount a household spends 
in a given period of time, and are generally considered 
a  better  measure  of  living  standards  than  traditional 
metrics such as income.

For  asset-based  wealth  measures,  we  employ 
training and test examples from the Demographic and 
Health  Surveys  (DHS),  an  independent  organization 
that  collects  health  and  household  asset  data  in 
developing  countries 
includes 
questions  such  as  whether  the  household  owns  a 
refrigerator, whether it owns a car, and whether it has 
access  to  electricity,  and  these  asset-based  questions 
are then used to create a continuous wealth index that 
we  try  to  predict.  The  wealth  index  is  calculated  by 
creating  a  matrix  from  the  answers  to  the  survey 
questions, taking the first principal component of this 
matrix, and using a linear combination of its elements 
[5].

To train our model and evaluate its performance, 
we  use  a  10-fold  nested  cross-validation  scheme  for 
the L1 and L2 regression methods. In the outer loop 
of this procedure, we divide our training data into 10 
equally  sized,  disjoint  sets.  We  then  take  9  of  these 
sets,  combine 
this 
combined  set  into  10  equally  sized,  disjoint  subsets. 
In the inner loop of the procedure, we train our data 
on the subsets using standard 10-fold cross-validation 
and select a model. We then go back to the outer loop 
and test it on the 10th (previously unseen) set to get an 
estimated generalization error. We repeat this process 
10 times, leaving out each set once, and average the 
estimated generalization error from each run.  

The prediction metrics we use are the average r2

TSS  is  the  total  sum  of  squares,  a  measure  of  how 
much the data varies around its mean. The higher the 
r2, the better the model predicts the continuous wealth 
measure. 
 
5.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

We  run  OLS,  L1,  and  L2  regression  on  the 
Uganda and Tanzania data separately to train models 
for each country, and we also use the Uganda model 
to  predict  wealth  measures  in  Tanzania  to  see  how 
well that model generalizes.

In  predicting  consumption  expenditures,  we 
obtain  the  results  shown  in  Table  1  below  for  the 
Tanzania data and similar results for the Uganda data. 
By comparing the satellite test r2 columns, we can see 
that  ridge  regression  performs  the  best  of  the  three, 
approaching  survey  test  accuracy.  The  choice  of 
regularization 
extremely 
important—since  we  are  using  high-dimensional 
feature  vectors  and  training  on  relatively  small 
datasets, we must avoid overfitting. 

hyperparameter 

We  then  use  the  Uganda  model  to  predict 
consumption  expenditures  in  Tanzania  and  plot  the 
average  test  r2  for  both  countries  vs.  the  average 
Uganda  training  r2  to  obtain  Figure  2.  This  graph 
shows  where  the  model  begins  overfitting  for  the 
Uganda data (around r2 = 0.45), as well as the optimal 
training r2 for generalization to Tanzania (around r2 = 
0.3). Based on these results, we believe that computer 
vision  based  methods  for  poverty  prediction  should 
generalize well across national borders as long as the 
visual features of both countries are similar (Uganda 
and  Tanzania  are  neighboring  countries  in  sub-
Saharan  Africa,  with  comparable  geographies  and 
socioeconomic conditions).

The  rise  of  Big  Data 

in  recent  years  has 
precipitated  an  explosion  of  new  applications;  from 
robotics  to  computer  vision,  from  advertising  to 
movie  recommendation  algorithms,  big  data  and 
machine 
learning  are  now  almost  ubiquitous. 
However,  one  area  that  could  benefit  from  further 
attention is the allocation of resources for third-world 
countries.  One  challenge  that  has  been  impeding 
progress  in  the  area  of  developmental  economics  is 
the difficulty of obtaining reliable data in these areas 
of the world. We hope to improve this state of affairs 
by  accurately  predicting  poverty  levels  through  the 
proxies  of  consumption-based  wealth  measures  and 
asset-based  wealth  measures  without  the  use  of 
expensive surveys.

This  project  builds  on  work  done  by  the  Ermon 
the  Computer  Science  department  at 
group 
Stanford.  Previously,  Xie  et  al.  [1] 
trained  a 
convolutional  neural  network  (CNN) 
to  predict 
nighttime  light  intensities  from  daytime  satellite 
imagery.  This  CNN  output  a  4,096-dimensional 
feature vector.  

However, due to the scarcity of poverty data, we 
cannot train the CNN directly on poverty. Instead, we 
take a transfer learning approach with the assumption 
that the features useful for predicting nighttime light 
intensities  are  also  useful  for  predicting  poverty 
levels,  and  use  linear  regression  to  predict  poverty 
measures from satellite images with the feature vector 
output  by  the  CNN.  Thus,  our  inputs  are  daytime 
satellite images and our outputs are continuous wealth 
measure  predictions.  Figure  1  below  displays  the

2.  RELATED WORK 

The  field  of  computational  social  science  or 
computational sustainability is a relatively young one, 
so  opportunities  for  new  applications  of  machine 
learning  abound.  Early  work  on  identifying  poverty 
using  remote  sensing  was  presented  in  2014  by  data 
scientists from DataKind working in conjunction with 
the NGO GiveDirectly. Their goal was to identify the 
poorest villages in western Kenya in order to deliver 
direct  cash  transfers  to  the  very  poor.  In  their 
approach,  they  used  template  matching  to  find  roofs 
in  satellite  images,  then  hand-designed  conventional 
computer vision features such as color histograms that 
would allow them to classify roofs as either metal or 
thatched [2, 3]. They then used the ratio of metal roofs 
in each village as a proxy for the amount of poverty 
present.

A more recent approach to poverty prediction was 
published 
few  weeks  ago. 
Blumenstock et al. used mobile phone call record data 
from  a  large  mobile  provider  in  Rwanda  to  predict 
asset-based  wealth  measures  nationwide  [4].  In 
addition to using survey data, they conducted a small-
scale phone survey to collect personalized wealth data 
specific to their call record dataset. For their poverty 
measure, they used a wealth index based on the first 
principal  component  of  the  data  collected  on  survey 
respondent asset ownership, a method summarized by 
Filmer and Pritchett in [5].  

This  project  is  a  continuation  of  work  in  Prof. 
Stefano  Ermon’s  group  in  the  Stanford  AI  Lab.  As 
described  earlier,  Xie  et  al.  [1]  trained  a  CNN  to 
predict  nighttime 
intensities  from  daytime 
satellite imagery, and then used the learned filters to 
predict poverty. However, they worked exclusively on 
the  problem  of  predicting  binary  poverty  labels 
(classifying  each  location  as  either  “in-poverty”  or 
“poverty-free”),  while  we  attempt 
to  predict 
continuous  measures  of  socioeconomic  status  in  this 
project. In going from a binary classification problem 
to  a  continuous  wealth  regression  problem,  we  hope 
to provide more useful and fine-grained poverty data 
for the World Bank and other entities on the ground in 
Africa. 
 
3.  DATASET AND FEATURES 

We  use  satellite  images  from  Google  Earth  [6] 
covering  all  of  Uganda  and  Tanzania  to  predict 
poverty  in  both  countries.  Our  Uganda  set  includes 
641  household  clusters,  where  each  cluster  contains 
around 10 households surveyed. Since up to 5 km of 
jitter  is  added  to  each  reported  cluster  location  to 

locations,  where  each 

preserve the anonymity of the survey respondents, we 
tile  each  location  with  100  images  of  1  km2  each  to 
cover  a  10  km  by  10  km  area.  Our  Tanzania  set 
includes  400 
is 
subdivided as in the Uganda set. All images are 400 
pixels × 400 pixels—at Google Maps zoom level 16, 
this  corresponds  to  a  resolution  of  approximately  3 
meters  per  pixel.  Some  examples  of  our  satellite 
images are shown in the first row of Figure 1.

consumption 
expenditure-based and asset-based. For consumption-
based  wealth  measures,  we  procure  training  and  test 
examples  from  the  Living  Standards  Measurement 
Study  (LSMS).  The  LSMS  is  administered  by  the 
World  Bank  and  collects  consumption  expenditure 
data  at  the  household  level  [7].  These  consumption 
expenditures represent the amount a household spends 
in a given period of time, and are generally considered 
a  better  measure  of  living  standards  than  traditional 
metrics such as income. 

[8].  The  survey 

For  asset-based  wealth  measures,  we  employ 
training and test examples from the Demographic and 
Health  Surveys  (DHS),  an  independent  organization 
that  collects  health  and  household  asset  data  in 
developing  countries 
includes 
questions  such  as  whether  the  household  owns  a 
refrigerator, whether it owns a car, and whether it has 
access  to  electricity,  and  these  asset-based  questions 
are then used to create a continuous wealth index that 
we  try  to  predict.  The  wealth  index  is  calculated  by 
creating  a  matrix  from  the  answers  to  the  survey 
questions, taking the first principal component of this 
matrix, and using a linear combination of its elements 
[5].  
 
4.  METHODS 

We  use  linear  regression  to  predict  these  wealth 
measures  in  Uganda  and  Tanzania.  For  both  the 
consumption expenditures and the asset-based wealth 
measures,  we 
least  squares  (OLS) 
regression,  lasso  (L1)  regression,  and  ridge  (L2) 
regression.  

try  ordinary 

OLS  regression  seeks  to  minimize  the  distance 
between  the  predicted  wealth  values  and  the  true 
wealth values. We use x(i) to denote the input variables 
(the image features in this case), and y(i) to denote the 
output  variables  (the  continuous  wealth  measures). 
Let  h  represent  our  hypothesis,  and  θi  represent  the 
unknown parameters mapping from x to y. Also, let m 
be  the  number  of  training  examples  and  n  be  the 

L1 regression is similar to OLS, but it includes a 
regularization term to prevent overfitting the training 
set. Thus, it chooses θ and c to minimize  

number of features (4,096 here). Then ℎ=𝜃!𝑥, and 

OLS chooses θ to minimize the cost function

This method forces many of the θi parameters to zero, 
effectively finding a sparse feature representation.  

L2 regression is also similar to L1 regression, but 
it  uses  a  different  regularization  term.  The  cost 
function that it minimizes is

and this regularization encourages the θi parameters to 
be very small.

To train our model and evaluate its performance, 
we  use  a  10-fold  nested  cross-validation  scheme  for 
the L1 and L2 regression methods. In the outer loop 
of this procedure, we divide our training data into 10 
equally  sized,  disjoint  sets.  We  then  take  9  of  these 
sets,  combine 
this 
combined  set  into  10  equally  sized,  disjoint  subsets. 
In the inner loop of the procedure, we train our data 
on the subsets using standard 10-fold cross-validation 
and select a model. We then go back to the outer loop 
and test it on the 10th (previously unseen) set to get an 
estimated generalization error. We repeat this process 
10 times, leaving out each set once, and average the 
estimated generalization error from each run.  

The prediction metrics we use are the average r2 

values over the 10 folds, with r2 calculated as

where SSE is the sum of squared prediction errors and 
TSS  is  the  total  sum  of  squares,  a  measure  of  how 
much the data varies around its mean. The higher the 
r2, the better the model predicts the continuous wealth 
measure. 
 
5.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

We  run  OLS,  L1,  and  L2  regression  on  the 
Uganda and Tanzania data separately to train models 
for each country, and we also use the Uganda model 
to  predict  wealth  measures  in  Tanzania  to  see  how 
well that model generalizes. 
 

5.1  Predicting Consumption 

is 

In  predicting  consumption  expenditures,  we 
obtain  the  results  shown  in  Table  1  below  for  the 
Tanzania data and similar results for the Uganda data. 
By comparing the satellite test r2 columns, we can see 
that  ridge  regression  performs  the  best  of  the  three, 
approaching  survey  test  accuracy.  The  choice  of 
regularization 
extremely 
important—since  we  are  using  high-dimensional 
feature  vectors  and  training  on  relatively  small 
datasets, we must avoid overfitting.

We  then  use  the  Uganda  model  to  predict 
consumption  expenditures  in  Tanzania  and  plot  the 
average  test  r2  for  both  countries  vs.  the  average 
Uganda  training  r2  to  obtain  Figure  2.  This  graph 
shows  where  the  model  begins  overfitting  for  the 
Uganda data (around r2 = 0.45), as well as the optimal 
training r2 for generalization to Tanzania (around r2 = 
0.3). Based on these results, we believe that computer 
vision  based  methods  for  poverty  prediction  should 
generalize well across national borders as long as the 
visual features of both countries are similar (Uganda 
and  Tanzania  are  neighboring  countries  in  sub-
Saharan  Africa,  with  comparable  geographies  and 
socioeconomic conditions).

ridge regression for all of the combined data, and then

With this approach, we obtain the results shown in the 
“combined”  row  of  Table  2  and  in  Figure  3.  This 
figure and table come from the Uganda data set, but 
both  countries  yield  similar  results.  Clearly,  our 
model  does  a  better  job  discriminating  between 
households in rural areas than in urban areas. In fact, 
in the urban household group, we would attain better 
results  simply  by  predicting 
the  mean  urban 
expenditure rather than using our model.

5.3  Predicting Assets 

Finally,  we  run  OLS,  L1,  and  L2  regression  on 
the  asset-based  wealth  measures,  with  the  results 
shown  in  Table  3  for  Uganda,  (Tanzania  looks 
reasonably  similar).  Figure  5  plots  our  predicted 
wealth index against the true wealth index; the goal is 
to obtain a linear relationship between the two with a 
slope of 1, such that our predicted values map to the 
true values. Looking at the plot, we do in fact find a 
linear  trend  with  r2  =  0.653;  this  improves  upon  the 
results  published  in  Science  in  [4],  which  found  a 
trend with r2 = 0.46 using mobile phone record data. 
Our  hypothesis  is  that  asset-based  wealth  measures 
are  easier  to  predict  using  satellite  images  than 
consumption-based  measures—assets  can  actually  be 
seen in some cases, while consumption cannot.

points are shown in red and rural points are shown in blue. 

The urban and rural lines look very dissimilar. 

Our second approach involves pre-processing the 
data  to  separate  out  the  urban  and  rural  points,  and 
then  applying  ridge  regression  to  these  two  sets 
separately to build two distinct models. We obtain the 
results shown in Figure 4 and in the “separate” row of 
Table  2  (again  from  the  Uganda  data  set).  This 
approach significantly improves the r2 values of both 
the urban and rural sets.

ABSTRACT 

indicators  directly 

The  lack  of  reliable  poverty  data  in  developing 
countries  poses  a  major  challenge  for  making 
informed  policy  decisions  and  allocating  resources 
effectively in those areas of the world. Unfortunately, 
it  can  be  prohibitively  expensive 
to  frequently 
conduct comprehensive surveys that track measures of 
economic  progress.  A  cheap  and  scalable  method  of 
producing  poverty  maps  would  greatly  facilitate 
economic  progress  in  these  developing  countries.  In 
this  paper,  we  present  a  method  for  predicting 
socioeconomic 
from  satellite 
images. We take the output of a convolutional neural 
network  (CNN),  a  4,096-element  feature  vector,  and 
use  these  image  features  along  with  known  survey 
data  from  certain  parts  of  Uganda  and  Tanzania  to 
perform 
linear  regression  on  continuous  wealth 
measures.  We 
to  predict 
consumption-based  wealth  measures  and  asset-based 
wealth  measures  for  both  Uganda  and  Tanzania.  We 
find  that  our  machine-learning  based  predictions 
approach survey accuracy at a fraction of the cost.

We  use  satellite  images  from  Google  Earth  [6]

poverty  in  both  countries.  Our  Uganda  set  includes 
641  household  clusters,  where  each  cluster  contains

World  Bank  and  collects  consumption  expenditure 
data  at  the  household  level  [7].  These  consumption

in a given period of time, and are generally considered 
a  better  measure  of  living  standards  than  traditional 
metrics such as income.

For  asset-based  wealth  measures,  we  employ 
training and test examples from the Demographic and 
Health  Surveys  (DHS),  an  independent  organization 
that  collects  health  and  household  asset  data  in 
developing  countries 
includes 
questions  such  as  whether  the  household  owns  a 
refrigerator, whether it owns a car, and whether it has 
access  to  electricity,  and  these  asset-based  questions 
are then used to create a continuous wealth index that 
we  try  to  predict.  The  wealth  index  is  calculated  by 
creating  a  matrix  from  the  answers  to  the  survey 
questions, taking the first principal component of this 
matrix, and using a linear combination of its elements 
[5].

OLS  regression  seeks  to  minimize  the  distance 
between  the  predicted  wealth  values  and  the  true

(the image features in this case), and y(i) to denote the 
output  variables  (the  continuous  wealth  measures). 
Let  h  represent  our  hypothesis,  and  θi  represent  the 
unknown parameters mapping from x to y. Also, let m

equally  sized,  disjoint  sets.  We  then  take  9  of  these

and select a model. We then go back to the outer loop 
and test it on the 10th (previously unseen) set to get an 
estimated generalization error. We repeat this process 
10 times, leaving out each set once, and average the

We  run  OLS,  L1,  and  L2  regression  on  the 
Uganda and Tanzania data separately to train models 
for each country, and we also use the Uganda model 
to  predict  wealth  measures  in  Tanzania  to  see  how 
well that model generalizes. 
 

5.1  Predicting Consumption 

is 

In  predicting  consumption  expenditures,  we 
obtain  the  results  shown  in  Table  1  below  for  the 
Tanzania data and similar results for the Uganda data. 
By comparing the satellite test r2 columns, we can see 
that  ridge  regression  performs  the  best  of  the  three, 
approaching  survey  test  accuracy.  The  choice  of 
regularization 
extremely 
important—since  we  are  using  high-dimensional 
feature  vectors  and  training  on  relatively  small 
datasets, we must avoid overfitting. 

hyperparameter 

We  then  use  the  Uganda  model  to  predict 
consumption  expenditures  in  Tanzania  and  plot  the 
average  test  r2  for  both  countries  vs.  the  average 
Uganda  training  r2  to  obtain  Figure  2.  This  graph 
shows  where  the  model  begins  overfitting  for  the 
Uganda data (around r2 = 0.45), as well as the optimal 
training r2 for generalization to Tanzania (around r2 = 
0.3). Based on these results, we believe that computer 
vision  based  methods  for  poverty  prediction  should 
generalize well across national borders as long as the 
visual features of both countries are similar (Uganda 
and  Tanzania  are  neighboring  countries  in  sub-
Saharan  Africa,  with  comparable  geographies  and 
socioeconomic conditions).

consumption 
then 

examine  whether  our  model’s 
performance shows significant discrepancies between 
urban and rural areas. Our first approach is to perform 
ridge regression for all of the combined data, and then 
to look at the urban and rural households separately. 
With this approach, we obtain the results shown in the 
“combined”  row  of  Table  2  and  in  Figure  3.  This 
figure and table come from the Uganda data set, but 
both  countries  yield  similar  results.  Clearly,  our 
model  does  a  better  job  discriminating  between 
households in rural areas than in urban areas. In fact, 
in the urban household group, we would attain better 
results  simply  by  predicting 
the  mean  urban 
expenditure rather than using our model.

5.3  Predicting Assets 

Finally,  we  run  OLS,  L1,  and  L2  regression  on 
the  asset-based  wealth  measures,  with  the  results 
shown  in  Table  3  for  Uganda,  (Tanzania  looks 
reasonably  similar).  Figure  5  plots  our  predicted 
wealth index against the true wealth index; the goal is 
to obtain a linear relationship between the two with a 
slope of 1, such that our predicted values map to the 
true values. Looking at the plot, we do in fact find a 
linear  trend  with  r2  =  0.653;  this  improves  upon  the 
results  published  in  Science  in  [4],  which  found  a 
trend with r2 = 0.46 using mobile phone record data. 
Our  hypothesis  is  that  asset-based  wealth  measures 
are  easier  to  predict  using  satellite  images  than 
consumption-based  measures—assets  can  actually  be 
seen in some cases, while consumption cannot.

points are shown in red and rural points are shown in blue. 

The urban and rural lines look very dissimilar. 

Our second approach involves pre-processing the 
data  to  separate  out  the  urban  and  rural  points,  and 
then  applying  ridge  regression  to  these  two  sets 
separately to build two distinct models. We obtain the 
results shown in Figure 4 and in the “separate” row of 
Table  2  (again  from  the  Uganda  data  set).  This 
approach significantly improves the r2 values of both 
the urban and rural sets.

6.  CONCLUSION 

the  cost  of 

Our  predictions  for  consumption  expenditures 
approach  survey  accuracy,  while  our  predictions  for 
asset-based  wealth  measures  improve  upon  recent 
state-of-the-art  results.  Additionally,  our  poverty 
estimation  techniques  based  on  remote  sensing  and 
machine learning can be applied on a global scale at a 
fraction  of 
traditional  survey-based 
methods.  Cheaply  and  accurately  predicting  poverty 
in  developing  countries  can  help  governments  and 
non-profits  better  allocate  their  resources  and  create 
effective policies. In the future, we hope to extend this 
work by applying these techniques to other countries 
and  creating  poverty  maps  with  greater  geographic 
coverage.  In  addition,  we  hypothesize  that  poverty 
dynamics  include  predictable  temporal  and  spatial 
relationships. We hope to obtain satellite images from 
different points in time and then create a probabilistic 
graphical  model  that  can  take  into  account  poverty 
relationships  between  points  that  are  neighbors  in 
both time and space.
