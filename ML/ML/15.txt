I. Introduction 

 
Fantasy football, just like the game of football itself, as grown from a benign neighborhood pastime into 
an immensely profitable corporate industry. Over the past decade, the number of individuals who play in 
a fantasy football league has grown by 450% to a total of 56.8 million people.1 Through their purchase 
of website memberships, league entrance fees, and draft ‘cheat sheets,’ fantasy football has become a 
$27 billion dollar market. To put this into perspective, the average valuation of an NFL team is a mere 
$1.97 billion (while the team with the highest net worth is the Dallas Cowboys, at ‘just’ $4 billion).2 
 
However, outside the television pundits and online soothsayers, there has been relatively little formal 
work done on how to predict the fantasy value of a given player. For this project, I used various machine 
learning tools to try to do just that. I focused on the largest-growing sector of the industry: daily fantasy 
leagues, where participants pay an entry fee and are given a certain amount of “fantasy dollars” with 
which to purchase a team, with one player for every position. Each player’s price is determined based on 
how well the league projects him to perform that week. 
 
Because of the lack of rigorous examination of the expected payout of any given player, there are sure to 
be  mispriced  players  whose  hidden  value  can  be  exploited  by  a  fantasy  competitor.  I  aim  with  this 
project to help the fantasy sports industry move closer to an equilibrium that would be predicted by the 
Efficient Market Hypothesis, where asset prices fully reflect all available information. 
 
I used three models: Linear Regression, Random Forests, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. 
For each model, I used as input every player’s statistics in the previous weeks of the season, as well as 
the team he was playing in each week. I then predicted how each player would do against his specific 
opponent  in  each  of  the  relevant  fantasy  categories  (passing  yards,  rushing  touchdowns,  etc.)  in  the 
coming week.

As previously stated, very few people have attempted to use machine learning to predict fantasy football 
outcomes  (or,  if  they  have,  they  are  using  their  findings  to  take  advantage  of  the  information 
asymmetries in this infant market). In fact, I was only able to find a single research paper on the topic: 
Roman  Lutz  of  the  University  of  Massachusetts  Amherst  used  Support  Vector  Regression  to  try  to 
predict the fantasy scores of NFL quarterbacks, with some promising results.3 Seeing that SVMs were 
already attempted, I decided to build a basic linear regression model to see how it performs, and then run 
diagnostics on its performance to see where it would be most fruitful to go next. 
 

III. Dataset and Features 

I gathered the weekly player statistics for each of the first 11 weeks of this NFL season from NFL.com.4 
Considering that there are 32 teams playing almost every week, each team having around nine players 
making  offensive  statistical  contributions  on  any  given  Sunday,  this  came  out  to  around  3,200  data 
points. 
 
For every week from NFL Week 4 through NFL Week 11, I trained each model using the data from all 
the previous weeks, and tested each model on the current week. I decided to start training after three 
weeks of data had been logged because a player’s statistics from just one or two games would probably 
not be enough to predict his future performance. The X values for each data point were the player and 
opposing team for the given contest, and the Y values were the resulting fantasy statistics for that player.

weeks of data had been logged because a player’s statistics from just one or two games would probably 
not be enough to predict his future performance. The X values for each data point were the player and 
opposing team for the given contest, and the Y values were the resulting fantasy statistics for that player. 

 

To  represent  each  player  in  vector  form,  I  simply  constructed  a  binary  dimension  for  each  player. 
Because there were 531 total players in the data set, this means that I created 531 dimensions. For any 
given data point of a specific player in a specific game, each of these added dimensions contained a ‘0’ 
except for the one corresponding to that player. I did the same process to represent the opposing team 
the player was going against in that game. Because there are 32 teams in the NFL, I added another 32 
dimensions,  each  of  which  contained  a  ‘0’  except  for  the  one  corresponding  to  the  correct  opposing 
team. In total, therefore, each X value was a vector of 563 binary values (only two of which were ‘1’). 
  
The  fantasy  leagues  I  was  evaluating  used  nine 
statistical  categories  to  give  each  player  a  fantasy 
score  (See  Table  1).  For  each  data  point,  the 
player’s  statistical  performance  in  each  category 
represented the Y value. 
 
When  discussing  the  error  of  my  models  in  this 
paper, I will be referring to the sum of normalized 
squared error as given by following equation:

Normalizing the squared error by the estimate of the population’s standard deviation is necessitated by 
the differing units of the statistical categories: if my model is able to predict a running back’s rush yards 
to within ten yards, that should be considered a resounding success. However, if my model predicts that 
he will get ten more touchdowns than he eventually does, that would be a grave error indeed. I owe the 
idea to normalize this way to Daniel O’Neel and Reed Johnson’s 2014 CS229 paper.5 
 

IV. Methods 

 
Model 1: Linear Regression 
 
To begin my examination of fantasy football predictions, I decided to run a basic linear model, using 
MATLAB’s ‘fitlm’ function. Training and testing this model for every week, I generated learning curves 
for each statistical category (See Figures 1 and 2 for examples).  
 
Each of the learning curves had the same general shape: the model would steadily improve until roughly 
midseason,  and  then  the  slope  of  the  test  error  would  flatten  out,  with  a  significant  gap  between  the 
training and test errors. This implied that the model suffered from a variance problem more than a bias 
problem. 
 

 
A common remedy to high variance is simply to collect more data points; however, since I had collected 
every possible point from the current NFL season, my options were limited. I could have collected data

training and test errors. This implied that the model suffered from a variance problem more than a bias 
problem. 
 

 
A common remedy to high variance is simply to collect more data points; however, since I had collected 
every possible point from the current NFL season, my options were limited. I could have collected data 

  

 

from  previous  years  to  try  to  use  a  player’s  performances  from  earlier  in  his  career  as  predictors. 
However, considering the constantly-shifting landscape of personnel and scheme in the NFL, as well as 
the fact that some of the top performers in the league are rookies who do not have previous seasons to 
analyze, this strategy seemed unlikely to bear fruit. 
 
Model 2: Random Forests 
 
Random Forests (RFs) are a regression method that builds many regression trees (with no pruning) from 
the inputted data, and then outputs the mean prediction of all of the individual trees. In order to bifurcate 
the trees, RFs form an estimation of what variables are important to the regression, and thus they work 
well  with  data  sets  with  large  feature  sets  (like  my  own).6  Further,  one  of  the  reasons  RFs  were 
developed was to correct for decision trees’ proclivity to overfit the data; thus, it seemed a perfect tool to 
combat the variance of my linear model.7 
 
To  implement  RFs,  I  used  R’s  ‘randomForest’  package.  As  will  be  seen,  RFs  did  turn  out  to  be  an 
effective tool in predicting scores, especially towards the beginning of the season when other models 
were still suffering from very high test error. 
 
Model 3: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines 
 
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is a nonparametric regression method that makes no 
immediate  assumptions  about  the  relationship  between  the  data.  Using  spline  functions  (piecewise-
polynomials that allow there to be “kink” points in the regression lines), MARS automatically models 
nonlinearities  and  interactions  between  the  variables.8  As  I  was  unsure  whether  there  were  any  such 
hidden relationships in my dataset, MARS proved immensely useful. Further, because it partitions the 
input space into multiple regions, it is also particularly suitable for data with large feature sets (again, 
like my own).9 
 
To implement MARS, I used R’s ‘earth’ package. Because MARS allows arbitrarily many degrees of 
interaction between the variables, I needed to determine up to what degree the model would be effective. 
MARS, as a nonparametric model with a lot of flexibility, tends to overfit the data if the degree is too 
high, resulting in artificially low training error but inflated test error. The ‘earth’ package in R, however, 
uses a pruning technique to limit the allowed complexity of the model; therefore, if the degree is set too 
high, the package simply ignores the higher interaction terms. In our case, the model minimized test error 
at Degree 3, and so for all subsequent degrees the errors were precisely the same (see Figure 3). 
 

Model 3.i: Weighted MARS 
 
Finally, it occurred to me that the model might be improved if recent weeks were weighted more heavily 
than performances from earlier in the year. Conceivably, a player could have a “trajectory” through the 
season; perhaps he is an aging player whose physical abilities are declining, or a rookie who is learning 
the ropes and getting steadily better.

III. Dataset and Features 

I gathered the weekly player statistics for each of the first 11 weeks of this NFL season from NFL.com.4 
Considering that there are 32 teams playing almost every week, each team having around nine players 
making  offensive  statistical  contributions  on  any  given  Sunday,  this  came  out  to  around  3,200  data 
points. 
 
For every week from NFL Week 4 through NFL Week 11, I trained each model using the data from all 
the previous weeks, and tested each model on the current week. I decided to start training after three

Using  the  conventional  “Gaussian”  weighting  formula  with 
various bandwidths, I ran MARS and found that the test errors 
steadily increased as the bandwidth got smaller, with the lowest 
error being that of the original unweighted model (see Figure 4). 
Therefore,  more  recent  games  have  no  more  predictive  power

Finding the Optimal Fantasy Football Team

I. Introduction 

 
Fantasy football, just like the game of football itself, as grown from a benign neighborhood pastime into 
an immensely profitable corporate industry. Over the past decade, the number of individuals who play in 
a fantasy football league has grown by 450% to a total of 56.8 million people.1 Through their purchase 
of website memberships, league entrance fees, and draft ‘cheat sheets,’ fantasy football has become a 
$27 billion dollar market. To put this into perspective, the average valuation of an NFL team is a mere 
$1.97 billion (while the team with the highest net worth is the Dallas Cowboys, at ‘just’ $4 billion).2 
 
However, outside the television pundits and online soothsayers, there has been relatively little formal 
work done on how to predict the fantasy value of a given player. For this project, I used various machine 
learning tools to try to do just that. I focused on the largest-growing sector of the industry: daily fantasy 
leagues, where participants pay an entry fee and are given a certain amount of “fantasy dollars” with 
which to purchase a team, with one player for every position. Each player’s price is determined based on 
how well the league projects him to perform that week. 
 
Because of the lack of rigorous examination of the expected payout of any given player, there are sure to 
be  mispriced  players  whose  hidden  value  can  be  exploited  by  a  fantasy  competitor.  I  aim  with  this 
project to help the fantasy sports industry move closer to an equilibrium that would be predicted by the 
Efficient Market Hypothesis, where asset prices fully reflect all available information. 
 
I used three models: Linear Regression, Random Forests, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. 
For each model, I used as input every player’s statistics in the previous weeks of the season, as well as 
the team he was playing in each week. I then predicted how each player would do against his specific 
opponent  in  each  of  the  relevant  fantasy  categories  (passing  yards,  rushing  touchdowns,  etc.)  in  the 
coming week. 

 

 

II. Related Work 

 
As previously stated, very few people have attempted to use machine learning to predict fantasy football 
outcomes  (or,  if  they  have,  they  are  using  their  findings  to  take  advantage  of  the  information 
asymmetries in this infant market). In fact, I was only able to find a single research paper on the topic: 
Roman  Lutz  of  the  University  of  Massachusetts  Amherst  used  Support  Vector  Regression  to  try  to 
predict the fantasy scores of NFL quarterbacks, with some promising results.3 Seeing that SVMs were 
already attempted, I decided to build a basic linear regression model to see how it performs, and then run 
diagnostics on its performance to see where it would be most fruitful to go next. 
 

III. Dataset and Features 

I gathered the weekly player statistics for each of the first 11 weeks of this NFL season from NFL.com.4 
Considering that there are 32 teams playing almost every week, each team having around nine players 
making  offensive  statistical  contributions  on  any  given  Sunday,  this  came  out  to  around  3,200  data 
points. 
 
For every week from NFL Week 4 through NFL Week 11, I trained each model using the data from all 
the previous weeks, and tested each model on the current week. I decided to start training after three 
weeks of data had been logged because a player’s statistics from just one or two games would probably 
not be enough to predict his future performance. The X values for each data point were the player and 
opposing team for the given contest, and the Y values were the resulting fantasy statistics for that player. 

 

To  represent  each  player  in  vector  form,  I  simply  constructed  a  binary  dimension  for  each  player. 
Because there were 531 total players in the data set, this means that I created 531 dimensions. For any 
given data point of a specific player in a specific game, each of these added dimensions contained a ‘0’ 
except for the one corresponding to that player. I did the same process to represent the opposing team 
the player was going against in that game. Because there are 32 teams in the NFL, I added another 32 
dimensions,  each  of  which  contained  a  ‘0’  except  for  the  one  corresponding  to  the  correct  opposing 
team. In total, therefore, each X value was a vector of 563 binary values (only two of which were ‘1’). 
  
The  fantasy  leagues  I  was  evaluating  used  nine 
statistical  categories  to  give  each  player  a  fantasy 
score  (See  Table  1).  For  each  data  point,  the 
player’s  statistical  performance  in  each  category 
represented the Y value. 
 
When  discussing  the  error  of  my  models  in  this 
paper, I will be referring to the sum of normalized 
squared error as given by following equation: 
 

Table 1: Fantasy Scoring System

Normalizing the squared error by the estimate of the population’s standard deviation is necessitated by 
the differing units of the statistical categories: if my model is able to predict a running back’s rush yards 
to within ten yards, that should be considered a resounding success. However, if my model predicts that 
he will get ten more touchdowns than he eventually does, that would be a grave error indeed. I owe the 
idea to normalize this way to Daniel O’Neel and Reed Johnson’s 2014 CS229 paper.5 
 

IV. Methods 

 
Model 1: Linear Regression 
 
To begin my examination of fantasy football predictions, I decided to run a basic linear model, using 
MATLAB’s ‘fitlm’ function. Training and testing this model for every week, I generated learning curves 
for each statistical category (See Figures 1 and 2 for examples).  
 
Each of the learning curves had the same general shape: the model would steadily improve until roughly 
midseason,  and  then  the  slope  of  the  test  error  would  flatten  out,  with  a  significant  gap  between  the 
training and test errors. This implied that the model suffered from a variance problem more than a bias 
problem. 
 

 
A common remedy to high variance is simply to collect more data points; however, since I had collected 
every possible point from the current NFL season, my options were limited. I could have collected data 

  

 

from  previous  years  to  try  to  use  a  player’s  performances  from  earlier  in  his  career  as  predictors. 
However, considering the constantly-shifting landscape of personnel and scheme in the NFL, as well as 
the fact that some of the top performers in the league are rookies who do not have previous seasons to 
analyze, this strategy seemed unlikely to bear fruit. 
 
Model 2: Random Forests 
 
Random Forests (RFs) are a regression method that builds many regression trees (with no pruning) from 
the inputted data, and then outputs the mean prediction of all of the individual trees. In order to bifurcate 
the trees, RFs form an estimation of what variables are important to the regression, and thus they work 
well  with  data  sets  with  large  feature  sets  (like  my  own).6  Further,  one  of  the  reasons  RFs  were 
developed was to correct for decision trees’ proclivity to overfit the data; thus, it seemed a perfect tool to 
combat the variance of my linear model.7 
 
To  implement  RFs,  I  used  R’s  ‘randomForest’  package.  As  will  be  seen,  RFs  did  turn  out  to  be  an 
effective tool in predicting scores, especially towards the beginning of the season when other models 
were still suffering from very high test error. 
 
Model 3: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines 
 
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) is a nonparametric regression method that makes no 
immediate  assumptions  about  the  relationship  between  the  data.  Using  spline  functions  (piecewise-
polynomials that allow there to be “kink” points in the regression lines), MARS automatically models 
nonlinearities  and  interactions  between  the  variables.8  As  I  was  unsure  whether  there  were  any  such 
hidden relationships in my dataset, MARS proved immensely useful. Further, because it partitions the 
input space into multiple regions, it is also particularly suitable for data with large feature sets (again, 
like my own).9 
 
To implement MARS, I used R’s ‘earth’ package. Because MARS allows arbitrarily many degrees of 
interaction between the variables, I needed to determine up to what degree the model would be effective. 
MARS, as a nonparametric model with a lot of flexibility, tends to overfit the data if the degree is too 
high, resulting in artificially low training error but inflated test error. The ‘earth’ package in R, however, 
uses a pruning technique to limit the allowed complexity of the model; therefore, if the degree is set too 
high, the package simply ignores the higher interaction terms. In our case, the model minimized test error 
at Degree 3, and so for all subsequent degrees the errors were precisely the same (see Figure 3). 
 

Model 3.i: Weighted MARS 
 
Finally, it occurred to me that the model might be improved if recent weeks were weighted more heavily 
than performances from earlier in the year. Conceivably, a player could have a “trajectory” through the 
season; perhaps he is an aging player whose physical abilities are declining, or a rookie who is learning 
the ropes and getting steadily better. 

 

 
Using  the  conventional  “Gaussian”  weighting  formula  with 
various bandwidths, I ran MARS and found that the test errors 
steadily increased as the bandwidth got smaller, with the lowest 
error being that of the original unweighted model (see Figure 4). 
Therefore,  more  recent  games  have  no  more  predictive  power 
than earlier games, and the model was needlessly throwing away 
information by using different weights. 
 

V. Results 

 
Figures 5 and 6 show how well the models performed relative to each other in two statistical categories. 
In most categories, the MARS models consistently performed the best in terms of normalized test error. 
 

  

 
There  were  a  few  categories  that  were  inherently  more  difficult  to  predict  across  all  models,  most 
notably fumbles and interceptions (see Figure 7). This makes some intuitive sense: while statistics such 
as total yards are accumulated over the course of an entire game (and thus not as susceptible to random 
chance),  a  game’s  solitary  interception  can  be  caused  by  the  slightest  slip  of  the  finger  by  the 
quarterback, and the one fumble in a running back’s season occurs because the defender’s helmet hit the 
ball in just the right location. Thus, turnovers are immensely difficult (if not impossible) to predict. 

 

      

 
To see how my models performed relative to real-life sports columnists and commentators, I ran the 
quarterback data through all three models and predicted who the top seven fantasy options would be for 
Week 11. I then compared my rankings to those of two professional prognosticators (see Table 2).10, 11 

As one can see, my rankings did very well compared to those of the analysts. All three models correctly 
chose four or five of the players who did actually end up ranked in the top seven (highlighted in green 
above), with relatively few gross over-appreciations (defined as players who actually ranked twentieth 
or  worse,  highlighted  in  red  above).  In  contrast,  both  professional  analysts  grossly  overvalued  two 
players:  Derek  Carr  (24th)  and  Philip  Rivers  (25th).  These  missteps  are  especially  embarrassing 
considering that there were only 25 quarterbacks in the model. 
 
One of the principal reason my models outperformed the ‘experts’ is that the latter base their decisions 
largely on the reputation of quarterbacks. Notice that both Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers were highly 
ranked by the two experts. Brady and Rodgers are two of the most renowned and prominent players in 
the league; they have had a lot of success in years past (and, indeed in some weeks this year), and so 
many  simply  assume  they  will  always  play  well  going  forward.  However,  while  neither  of  them 
performed horribly, they both only ended up in the middle of the pack. My model, instead of relying on 
name  recognition,  took  all  the  available  information  –  who  they  were  playing,  how  they  did  against 
specific defenses in the past – and correctly ranked them outside the top seven. 
 
There  are  some  things  even  my  rankings  could  not  predict,  however:  notice  that  Jay  Cutler,  who 
eventually earned mediocre statistics that week, is ranked in the top seven by all my models. Cutler had 
been having a very strong season up to that point, but since that week he has been playing relatively 
poorly. There was no indication in the previous statistics that this would happen, so my model could not 
have known. Football is a human game, after all, and some things simply cannot be predicted. 
 

VI. Conclusion 

 
My models can already be used by fantasy competitors to purchase a team that will be successful with 
high probability. One must simply look up the team matchups for the week, input the binary data into 
the  models,  and  receive  back  fantasy  score  projections.  From  there,  it  is  a  relatively  simply  linear 
optimization problem to discover the ‘best’ team you can buy with your fantasy budget constraint: 
 

max𝐹𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑦𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠 
  ≤𝐵𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑡𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡 
𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡  𝑜𝑓  𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟
𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑  𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑠=1            ∀𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 

!"#$!!"#$  !"#$%&’

𝑠.𝑡.

 
All of the above can be represented in matrix form, and inputted into any linear optimization software. 
 
Going forward, however, my models can definitely be improved. There are many more input variables 
that can be tested for predictive power. For instance, how experienced is the player? If he is a rookie, he 
is probably not going to be able to have the immediate statistical success that a battle-hardened veteran 
might. Is the player recovering from a recent injury? This season, a very good quarterback named Tony 
Romo was injured and could not play for a few weeks. When he returned, many expected him to return to 
his winning ways. Romo played very poorly at first, however, taking some time to get back into form. 
Perhaps  if  injuries  had  been  incorporated  into  my  models,  this  could  have  been  predicted.  Further,  a 
player’s injuries can have implications for his teammates as well. This season another great quarterback, 
Ben Roethlisberger of the Steelers, also had to take a few weeks off because of an injury. During this 
time, one of the best wide receivers in the NFL, Antonio Brown, also on the Steelers, had some relatively 
poor statistical Sundays because he was forced to play catch with an inferior backup quarterback. If my 
model had somehow incorporated teammates’ injuries, perhaps this, too, could have been predicted. 
 
Overall, however, I am happy with the performance of my models to this point, as they have already 
bested the predictions of people who get paid to predict football statistics for a living. Perhaps my dream 
of an Efficient Fantasy Football Market, where fantasy values fully reflect all available information and 
player futures are traded on the margin, is not too far off.

the  models,  and  receive  back  fantasy  score  projections.  From  there,  it  is  a  relatively  simply  linear 
optimization problem to discover the ‘best’ team you can buy with your fantasy budget constraint: 
 

max𝐹𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑦𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠 
  ≤𝐵𝑢𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑡𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡 
𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡  𝑜𝑓  𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟
𝑃𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑  𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑠=1            ∀𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 

!"#$!!"#$  !"#$%&’

𝑠.𝑡.

 
All of the above can be represented in matrix form, and inputted into any linear optimization software. 
 
Going forward, however, my models can definitely be improved. There are many more input variables 
that can be tested for predictive power. For instance, how experienced is the player? If he is a rookie, he 
is probably not going to be able to have the immediate statistical success that a battle-hardened veteran 
might. Is the player recovering from a recent injury? This season, a very good quarterback named Tony 
Romo was injured and could not play for a few weeks. When he returned, many expected him to return to 
his winning ways. Romo played very poorly at first, however, taking some time to get back into form. 
Perhaps  if  injuries  had  been  incorporated  into  my  models,  this  could  have  been  predicted.  Further,  a 
player’s injuries can have implications for his teammates as well. This season another great quarterback, 
Ben Roethlisberger of the Steelers, also had to take a few weeks off because of an injury. During this 
time, one of the best wide receivers in the NFL, Antonio Brown, also on the Steelers, had some relatively 
poor statistical Sundays because he was forced to play catch with an inferior backup quarterback. If my 
model had somehow incorporated teammates’ injuries, perhaps this, too, could have been predicted. 
 
Overall, however, I am happy with the performance of my models to this point, as they have already 
bested the predictions of people who get paid to predict football statistics for a living. Perhaps my dream 
of an Efficient Fantasy Football Market, where fantasy values fully reflect all available information and 
player futures are traded on the margin, is not too far off.
