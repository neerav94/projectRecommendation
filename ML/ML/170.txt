ABSTRACT 

 

The rise of social media and the large, rich datasets they make accessible have 
allowed us to learn about people not only through information shared explicitly, 
but also through information shared implicitly in the form of trends and 
patterns. Here, we emphasize the value of implicit data by creating a machine-
learning algorithm that uses basic information, photos, and published text on 
Facebook profiles to predict sexual orientation in males. We constructed a 
model with Naïve Bayes classifiers and a Support Vector Machine, performing 
on different types of data. We used 10-fold stratified cross-validation on our 
dataset as a measure of generalization error. Currently, we have created a model 
with an accuracy of 91.02%. 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 

In today’s world, our digital lives have 
merged seamlessly with our personal and 
professional lives. We use social media to 
share life events, pictures, interests, and 
opinions. We cultivate an online identity, both 
explicitly and implicitly, through what we 
share and how we choose to communicate on 
certain social media platforms [1]. 

This phenomenon has not gone unnoticed 

by the people and organizations that are 
interested in studying other people. Companies 
make predictions about which products 
different individuals would likely be interested 
in [2]. Politicians target key demographics to 
mobilize campaign support. Researchers study 
patterns to understand how humans interact 
and communicate. 

Similarly, we want to know if there is 
enough implicit information on people’s 
Facebook profiles to make a prediction of their 
sexual orientation. On one level, a learning 
algorithm to distinguish non-heterosexuals is a 
lighthearted way to study the power of implicit 
information and to allow interested parties to 

connect with similar others. On a deeper level, 
creating a machine learning algorithm is a very 
organic way to study a population, as it 
minimizes prior assumptions, being initialized 
as a “blank slate” and developing patterns 
based solely on the data [3]. 
 
II. RELATED WORK 
 

There is not an extensive amount of 

existing literature describing research 
concentrating on sexual orientation alone based 
on social media profiles; however, there have 
been multiple machine learning algorithms 
developed to use very few basic features of 
social media websites to determine a number 
of highly sensitive personal attributes. One of 
these algorithms was developed by Kosinksi, 
Stillwell, and Graepel [1]: based solely on 
Facebook likes, detailed demographic profiles, 
and psychometric tests, Kosinksi et al. were 
able to use dimensionality reduction and 
logistic regression to determine the sexuality 
(homosexual vs. heterosexual males), race 
(African American vs. Caucasian), and

political stance (Democrat vs. Republican) of 
each user. 

While predicting the sexuality, race, and 
political stance of a person using their variety 
of methods is useful, we posit that these 
attributes could actually be dependent on each 
other [4]. Then, we could predict one — like 
sexual orientation — using the others as 
features and without having to resort to tests 
and demographic profiles, instead relying on 
social media information alone. 

We use a model that is not only based on 

Facebook photos and likes, but also on 
explicitly provided information such as a 
person’s hometown, religious affiliation, 
relationship status, etc., as well as text 
communication through timeline posts and 
photo comments. Taking into account this host 
of details may prove fruitful for predicting a 
person’s sexuality. 
 
III. DATASET AND FEATURES 
 

Our aim in this project was to distinguish 
heterosexual (non-LGBTQ, y = 0) individuals 
from non-heterosexual (LGBTQ, y = 1) 
individuals. (We made the assumption that 
sexual orientation is binary, rather than a 
spectrum, for the sake of classification 
simplicity.) 

Our training set included N = 167 

Facebook profiles and information included in 
those profiles in the following categories: 
 

“About” section 
•  Hometown 
•  Political affiliation 
•  Religious affiliation 
• 
•  Relationship status 

Interested in 

 
“Friends” section 

•  Number of friends 
•  Male-to-female friend ratio 
•  Number of LGBTQ friends 
•  LGBTQ-to-non-LGBTQ friend ratio 

“Profile Photo” section 

•  Use of rainbow filter (2015) 
•  Use of equality sign (2012) 
•  Number of profile photos with one 

•  Number of profile photos with one 

•  Number of prom photos with one 

•  Number of prom photos with one 

other male 

female 

other male 

female 

“Timeline” section 
•  Status updates 
•  Photo comments 
•  Shared links 

 

Our dataset was 62% LGBTQ and 38% 

non-LGBTQ. In order to restrict our sampling 
population, we limited our selection pool to 
only Stanford undergraduate students. 

For the LGBTQ portion of our training set, 

we picked a simple random sample of user 
profiles from the secret LGBTQ groups for the 
classes of 2019, 2018, and 2016 at Stanford. 
For the non-LGBTQ portion, we picked a 
simple random sample of students from the 
official undergraduate class groups for the 
classes of 2019, 2018, and 2016, and we 
crosschecked with the list of LGBTQ people to 
ensure no overlap. (We made the assumption 
that all Facebook users that are not in the 
LGBTQ groups are not LGBTQ.) 

We did not use Facebook’s Graph API for 
the sake of flexibility, and did not use robotic 
data collection methods due to Facebook’s 
terms of service. Rather, we gathered all our 
manually and used custom cleaning/parsing 
scripts to process the data. 

We would also like to note that all of our 

data example were anonymized; the names 
associated with each datapoint was erased after 
the collection process in order to protect 
privacy.

IV. METHODS 
 

We decided to integrate two Naïve Bayes 
classifier components and a Support Vector 
Machine in our model. 

A Naïve Bayes classifier is a generative 

learning model that predicts the probability of 
a particular data vector given past distributions 
of discrete features [5], given by eq. (1): 

𝑛𝑖=1
𝑝𝑥𝑖𝑦=1𝑝(𝑦=1)

𝑝𝑥𝑖𝑦=1𝑝(𝑦=1)
+
𝑛𝑖=1

𝑝𝑥𝑖𝑦=0𝑝(𝑦=0)

 𝑝𝑦=1𝑥 =

𝑛𝑖=1

 

(1) 

Such an algorithm not only helped us 

determine a user’s sexuality from the text from 
his Facebook “Timeline” section, but could 
also provided us with a few of the most 
commonly used words among users marked as 
LGBT for further analysis [6]. 

Another algorithm that proved central was 

the Support Vector Machine, which is a 
discriminatory learning algorithm that finds an 
optimal decision boundary between the two 
different kinds of data points: by finding a 
hyperplane (w, b) [7] to maximize the quantity 
 

𝛾=min! 𝑦!{<𝒘,𝜙𝒙! >−𝑏} 

 
as exemplified in Fig. 1 below: 
 

 
FIG. 1. An example of a decision boundary 
created by running an SVM on a system 

Because our training examples are 

described by have both binary and continuous 
features, we created a model with two Naïve 

Bayes classifiers: one that analyzes the discrete 
attributes in a profile’s “About” and “Photos” 
sections, and one that analyzes the text from 
the profile’s “Timeline”. Each of these 
computes a score that is fed into the Support 
Vector Machine and combined with other 
continuously-valued features to assign a final 
classification, as illustrated below in Fig. 2: 

(2) 

FIG. 2. A diagram of the method involving Naïve Bayes 
and an SVM that was implemented 
 

In order to create a model that would 

generalize well, we did not use an empirical 
prior based on the skewed dataset, but rather 
computed a more accurate prior probability to 
be used in the algorithms based on the entire 
undergraduate population and LGBTQ group. 
 
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 

As of the latest version, our model runs 

with a training error of 2.40% and a 
generalization error of 8.98%. This suggests 
overfitting, and thus high variance, requiring a 
fix such as decreasing the number of features 
or adding more training examples to the 
training set. 

Nevertheless, the error is fairly low, 

considering that we did not have time to fine-
tune the algorithm to minimize error, and 
works quite proficiently on outside profiles 
that were not used in the dataset. 

Below, we provide a confusion matrix, 

which shows the predictive performance of the 
classification algorithm (Fig. 3).

Here, we include the ROC curve, which 
summarizes the performance of our classifier 
over all possible thresholds (Fig. 4). 
 

 

 

FIG. 4. ROC curve. The optimal curve has an area 
underneath it equal to 1. This curve has an area 
underneath it equal to 0.973, which is quite close to 1. 
 

As one can see, running an SVM on a 

dataset using only two of our features can still 
create an effective decision boundary between 
LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ data. This is 
illustrated in Fig. 5 below: 
 

 

 
FIG. 4. 2D SVM decision boundary. This plot shows the 
decision boundary for just two features: the number of 
LGBTQ friends (x-axis) and the log ratio of non-
LGBTQ-to-LGBTQ friends (y-axis). A remarkably clear 
separation between the two classes can be observed. 
 

We observed some interesting results from 
the Naïve Bayes text classifier that we ran for 
the text on each profile’s “Timeline”. Some of 
the words with highest predicting power, given

Facebook profiles to predict sexual orientation in males. We constructed a 
model with Naïve Bayes classifiers and a Support Vector Machine, performing 
on different types of data. We used 10-fold stratified cross-validation on our 
dataset as a measure of generalization error. Currently, we have created a model 
with an accuracy of 91.02%. 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 

In today’s world, our digital lives have 
merged seamlessly with our personal and 
professional lives. We use social media to 
share life events, pictures, interests, and 
opinions. We cultivate an online identity, both 
explicitly and implicitly, through what we 
share and how we choose to communicate on 
certain social media platforms [1]. 

This phenomenon has not gone unnoticed 

by the people and organizations that are 
interested in studying other people. Companies 
make predictions about which products 
different individuals would likely be interested 
in [2]. Politicians target key demographics to 
mobilize campaign support. Researchers study 
patterns to understand how humans interact 
and communicate. 

Similarly, we want to know if there is 
enough implicit information on people’s 
Facebook profiles to make a prediction of their 
sexual orientation. On one level, a learning 
algorithm to distinguish non-heterosexuals is a 
lighthearted way to study the power of implicit 
information and to allow interested parties to 

connect with similar others. On a deeper level, 
creating a machine learning algorithm is a very 
organic way to study a population, as it 
minimizes prior assumptions, being initialized 
as a “blank slate” and developing patterns 
based solely on the data [3]. 
 
II. RELATED WORK 
 

There is not an extensive amount of 

existing literature describing research 
concentrating on sexual orientation alone based 
on social media profiles; however, there have 
been multiple machine learning algorithms 
developed to use very few basic features of 
social media websites to determine a number 
of highly sensitive personal attributes. One of 
these algorithms was developed by Kosinksi, 
Stillwell, and Graepel [1]: based solely on 
Facebook likes, detailed demographic profiles, 
and psychometric tests, Kosinksi et al. were 
able to use dimensionality reduction and 
logistic regression to determine the sexuality 
(homosexual vs. heterosexual males), race 
(African American vs. Caucasian), and

political stance (Democrat vs. Republican) of 
each user. 

While predicting the sexuality, race, and 
political stance of a person using their variety 
of methods is useful, we posit that these 
attributes could actually be dependent on each 
other [4]. Then, we could predict one — like 
sexual orientation — using the others as 
features and without having to resort to tests 
and demographic profiles, instead relying on 
social media information alone. 

We use a model that is not only based on 

Facebook photos and likes, but also on 
explicitly provided information such as a 
person’s hometown, religious affiliation, 
relationship status, etc., as well as text 
communication through timeline posts and 
photo comments. Taking into account this host 
of details may prove fruitful for predicting a 
person’s sexuality. 
 
III. DATASET AND FEATURES 
 

Our aim in this project was to distinguish 
heterosexual (non-LGBTQ, y = 0) individuals 
from non-heterosexual (LGBTQ, y = 1) 
individuals. (We made the assumption that 
sexual orientation is binary, rather than a 
spectrum, for the sake of classification 
simplicity.) 

Our training set included N = 167 

Facebook profiles and information included in 
those profiles in the following categories: 
 

“About” section 
•  Hometown 
•  Political affiliation 
•  Religious affiliation 
• 
•  Relationship status 

Interested in 

 
“Friends” section 

•  Number of friends 
•  Male-to-female friend ratio 
•  Number of LGBTQ friends 
•  LGBTQ-to-non-LGBTQ friend ratio 

“Profile Photo” section 

•  Use of rainbow filter (2015) 
•  Use of equality sign (2012) 
•  Number of profile photos with one 

•  Number of profile photos with one 

•  Number of prom photos with one 

•  Number of prom photos with one 

other male 

female 

other male 

female 

“Timeline” section 
•  Status updates 
•  Photo comments 
•  Shared links 

 

Our dataset was 62% LGBTQ and 38% 

non-LGBTQ. In order to restrict our sampling 
population, we limited our selection pool to 
only Stanford undergraduate students. 

For the LGBTQ portion of our training set, 

we picked a simple random sample of user 
profiles from the secret LGBTQ groups for the 
classes of 2019, 2018, and 2016 at Stanford. 
For the non-LGBTQ portion, we picked a 
simple random sample of students from the 
official undergraduate class groups for the 
classes of 2019, 2018, and 2016, and we 
crosschecked with the list of LGBTQ people to 
ensure no overlap. (We made the assumption 
that all Facebook users that are not in the 
LGBTQ groups are not LGBTQ.) 

We did not use Facebook’s Graph API for 
the sake of flexibility, and did not use robotic 
data collection methods due to Facebook’s 
terms of service. Rather, we gathered all our 
manually and used custom cleaning/parsing 
scripts to process the data. 

We would also like to note that all of our 

data example were anonymized; the names 
associated with each datapoint was erased after 
the collection process in order to protect 
privacy.

IV. METHODS 
 

We decided to integrate two Naïve Bayes 
classifier components and a Support Vector 
Machine in our model. 

A Naïve Bayes classifier is a generative 

learning model that predicts the probability of 
a particular data vector given past distributions 
of discrete features [5], given by eq. (1): 

𝑛𝑖=1
𝑝𝑥𝑖𝑦=1𝑝(𝑦=1)

𝑝𝑥𝑖𝑦=1𝑝(𝑦=1)
+
𝑛𝑖=1

𝑝𝑥𝑖𝑦=0𝑝(𝑦=0)

 𝑝𝑦=1𝑥 =

𝑛𝑖=1

Such an algorithm not only helped us 

determine a user’s sexuality from the text from 
his Facebook “Timeline” section, but could 
also provided us with a few of the most 
commonly used words among users marked as 
LGBT for further analysis [6]. 

Another algorithm that proved central was 

the Support Vector Machine, which is a 
discriminatory learning algorithm that finds an 
optimal decision boundary between the two 
different kinds of data points: by finding a 
hyperplane (w, b) [7] to maximize the quantity 
 

𝛾=min! 𝑦!{<𝒘,𝜙𝒙! >−𝑏} 

 
as exemplified in Fig. 1 below: 
 

 
FIG. 1. An example of a decision boundary 
created by running an SVM on a system 

Because our training examples are 

described by have both binary and continuous 
features, we created a model with two Naïve 

Bayes classifiers: one that analyzes the discrete 
attributes in a profile’s “About” and “Photos” 
sections, and one that analyzes the text from 
the profile’s “Timeline”. Each of these 
computes a score that is fed into the Support 
Vector Machine and combined with other 
continuously-valued features to assign a final 
classification, as illustrated below in Fig. 2: 

(2) 

FIG. 2. A diagram of the method involving Naïve Bayes 
and an SVM that was implemented 
 

In order to create a model that would 

generalize well, we did not use an empirical 
prior based on the skewed dataset, but rather 
computed a more accurate prior probability to 
be used in the algorithms based on the entire 
undergraduate population and LGBTQ group. 
 
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 

As of the latest version, our model runs 

with a training error of 2.40% and a 
generalization error of 8.98%. This suggests 
overfitting, and thus high variance, requiring a 
fix such as decreasing the number of features 
or adding more training examples to the 
training set. 

Nevertheless, the error is fairly low, 

considering that we did not have time to fine-
tune the algorithm to minimize error, and 
works quite proficiently on outside profiles 
that were not used in the dataset. 

Below, we provide a confusion matrix, 

which shows the predictive performance of the 
classification algorithm (Fig. 3).

true positive rate, and the bottom right box shows the 
true negative rate. The top right and bottom left show the 
Type I and Type II errors, respectively. 

 

Here, we include the ROC curve, which 
summarizes the performance of our classifier 
over all possible thresholds (Fig. 4). 
 

 

 

FIG. 4. ROC curve. The optimal curve has an area 
underneath it equal to 1. This curve has an area 
underneath it equal to 0.973, which is quite close to 1. 
 

As one can see, running an SVM on a 

dataset using only two of our features can still 
create an effective decision boundary between 
LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ data. This is 
illustrated in Fig. 5 below: 
 

 

 
FIG. 4. 2D SVM decision boundary. This plot shows the 
decision boundary for just two features: the number of 
LGBTQ friends (x-axis) and the log ratio of non-
LGBTQ-to-LGBTQ friends (y-axis). A remarkably clear 
separation between the two classes can be observed. 
 

We observed some interesting results from 
the Naïve Bayes text classifier that we ran for 
the text on each profile’s “Timeline”. Some of 
the words with highest predicting power, given

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 

Our work is an example of how a powerful 

classifier can be built with some of the 
fundamental machine learning techniques. 
Combining a carefully-curated dataset, flexible 
machine learning model, and strong error 
testing metrics, we show both the power of 
implicit information and social media. 
Although an individual profile may not share 
information explicitly, it is possible to use the 
aggregation of sparse data from many profiles 
to train a learning algorithm to tell us whether 
certain present (or missing) data contributes to 
the probability [1, 2] of a person being LGBTQ 
or non-LGBTQ. Such a finding is interesting 
from both a scientific and ethical perspective. 
In the future, we would consider using a 

neural network on a similar but larger dataset, 
as the way that neural networks extract features 
may lend itself naturally to describing the 
complexities of identity and different subsets 
of discrete features. For instance, does omitting 
the "Interested in Women" field have more 
predictive power for someone in Saudi Arabia 
than someone in California? Such a model 
would allow these kinds of questions to be 
studied, and it would perhaps importantly lead 
to the confirmation or challenging of 
mainstream stereotypes.
