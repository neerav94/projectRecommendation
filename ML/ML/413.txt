Abstract—Our hypothesis is that the video game industry, in
the attempt to simulate a realistic experience, has inadvertently
collected very accurate data which can be used to solve problems
in the real world. In this paper we describe a novel approach
to soccer match prediction that makes use of only virtual data
collected from a video game(FIFA 2015).

Our results were comparable and in some places better than
results achieved by predictors that used real data. We also use
the data provided for each player and the players present in the
squad, to analyze the team strategy. Based on our analysis, we
were able to suggest better strategies for weak teams

I. INTRODUCTION

Sports betting has motivated many machine learning and rule
based attempts to solve this problem over the years but one of
the most common approaches was using some combination of
previous match results as a feature set. In this paper we attempt
a novel approach to Soccer Match Prediction that doesn’t use
match statistics. This, as far as we know, is the ﬁrst attempt to
predict soccer match outcomes using only “Virtual Data”(Video
game data). Our goal is to build a better or at least comparable
predictor than the ones based on “Real Data” which will verify
our hypothesis about the validity of video game data.

Video games have long become a multi-billion dollar industry
for a reason none other than the fact that they are really “good”.
And the reason they have become so good is because a lot
of resources have been spent on making them as realistic as
possible which requires collecting and curating a lot of real
world data. Of course this data has been collected for the sole
purpose of making the video simulation more realistic, thus
more engaging for the user. A representative of the a soccer
video game company said , “The information gathered by our
network of more than 1,300 scouts around the world, combined
with Prozone”s amazing performance data, makes this an in-
valuable tool for any football club that takes player recruitment
seriously”. If this statement is true, and the video games are
that accurate the question becomes: Can data collected by video
games be used for solving other problems in the same medium?
In this paper, we try to answer exactly this question.

The medium we looked at is European soccer and the video
game considered is “FIFA 2015”. Makers of this video game are
famous for creating the most realistic soccer player avatars that
look and act very much like real ones. In order to provide this
level of authenticity, experts have been hired to collect informa-
tion about the playing style of each player and curate this data so
that each player can be accurately represented as a combination
of 33+ features. This features include both physical(speed,
power, acceleration, etc) and technical skills(dribbling, heading,
accuracy, etc) represented as an integer from 1 to 100. These
features are updated constantly as the form of players change

over the season. It is interesting to point out that this data is
already being used to solve other problems - Scouts in English
Premiere League use video games to look for young, promising
players with speciﬁc skills.1. And not too long ago a video game
player was appointed as a general manager for a real soccer
team2.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
section 2 & 3 we describe the data sources for this project
and preprocessing. Section 4 describes our model selection for
match prediction and results. In section 5 we used unsupervised
learning techniques to identify the strategy used by the teams
based on their squads.

A. Previous Work

Sports prediction is obviously a very hot topic and has always
packed the interest of sports fans. Also, in countries where sports
betting is legal, sports prediction is as critical as predicting
stock prices. But despite this big interest in sports forecasting,
it was hard to ﬁnd serious published work on the subject. This
may be due to the fact that “Sports Prediction” is a bit too
far from academic interest. We were able to ﬁnd a few papers
from published in Economics journal. One paper [3] tried the
multi-layer perceptron for sports prediction, and explains how
hard it is predicting sports games. [4] investigated three other
prediction methods and compared their accuracy. Their result
shows that market prediction and betting odds provide much
better forecasts than tipsters. [2] anaylized a sports prediction
market of the FIFA World Cup 2006, and compared their
prediction accuracy based on history to a random draw. The
paper shows that history based prediction is better than a random
prediction.

Interestingly, it is more easy to ﬁnd many sprouts prediction
papers from other machine learning classes. Students tried to
predict their favorite sports game using machine learning. Many
different prediction algorithms have been used but they all had
one thing in common: they tried to predict match outcomes
based on previous match results. We didn’t ﬁnd any attempts at
strategy analysis or any instance of unsupervised learning. This
is mainly due to the limitation of their feature sets (previous
game history), they can only have small number of features.
And small number of features hide many factors of games. Thus
they could use only a small part of Machine Learning.

II. DATASET

In this project, we looked at games played in Spanish ‘La
Liga’(Primera Liga). There are 20 teams in the league who
play each other in a round-robin fashion twice(A plays B twice,
once at home and once away) which adds up to 380 ﬁxtures a
year. For this project, we aquired collection of data from three
different sources:

1) Fixture results

This represents the results of the played matches of ‘La
Liga’. It corresponds to the output variable in the pre-
diction algorithm. The scores where reduced to a binary
value of three categories: home win/draw/away win. Also
we collected line ups for each match. We focused on line
ups not teams, because teams tend to use different line
ups depending on strategy.
They were gathered from http://www.goal.com by script-
ing web-crawlers.

2) Real Data

3) Virtual Data

This data represents statistics about teams performance
from match history: goals, shots on target, yellow cards,
etc. We have looked at many examples of sports prediction
techniques and they all use data similar to this. This data
was used in this project to create a create a baseline
prediction algorithm that our new technique(using virtual
data) can be compared against.

This data was collected from http://soﬁfa.com, and repre-
sents 33 features for each players set by experts. Each
feature corresponds to a physical or technical skill of
player and is an integer value ranging (1, 100). These
are the features used by the video game to simulate the
actions of each player and in this paper we try to verify
how legitimate this data is, by training the predictor with it
and comparing the results to the predictor that uses “Real
Data”. The full set of “Virtual Features” can be found in
Table I.

Notice that Real Data and Virtual Data represent features for
the same output variables in Fixture results.

III. FEATURES AND PREPROCESSING

A. PCA

Sanity Check with PCA - “Virtual Data” was collected from
soﬁfa.com using web-crawlers, and represents a 33 feature
vecotor for each player in the league(total of 280 players).
Our hypothesis was that this data was sufﬁcient to build a
legitimate predictor for real match results but before we would

rated chuck of players are the goalkeepers.

start creating models and training we decided to do a basic
“sanity check”. Being familiar with the league and some of the
players we wanted to see if the scores given to the players are
consistent and are able to distinguish different type of players
from each other. In order to make the manual comparison of
280 players in 33 dimensional feature space more feasible we
applied PCA. This was a successful and a rather interesting use
of PCA, because by reducing the dimensions of the data to 3D(a
visually observable space) we could actually look at our data
and do a basic sanity check. First thing we noticed after plotting
the results of PCA(Figure 1) was a small set of points separated
from the rest. We checked and these points correspond to all
the goalkeepers in the league which is very intuitive because
soccer goalkeepers require a very different from set of skills
from ﬁeld players. Examining the results in Figure 1 further we
noticed that the top two players of the league ended up next to
each other on the 3D plot. In fact, in the reduced dimensional
space, it was easy to see that the players that are close to each
other are similar and the ones that are far away are not. We then
ran k-means clustering on the data and got three distinct groups
(Defensive Players, Offensive Players, Goalkeepers).

B. Real Data

“Real Data”collected from http://www.football-data.co.uk
represetns a set of 380 matches played between 20 teams.
Each match entry has 24 different statistics(home red cards,
away red cards, home team shots on target, etc). This data is
used to create a baseline predictor that our “virtual” predictor
can be compared against. The aggregation function basically
averages teams performance statistics over all the other matches.

Each match entry has 24 different statistics(home red cards,

used to create a baseline predictor that our “virtual” predictor

Team Stats(Team)i

Team Stat represents 12 statistics for a team for a given
match. Team Real Features is computed by averaging this stats
for all the other matches it has played in.

C. Virtual Data

“Virtual Data”represents individual soccer players but we
want
to predict an outcome of a match played between
two squads(a squad consists of 11 players). We deﬁne an
aggregation function that represents a squad as a combination
of the features of the players it consists of. First, we just
calculated average values of each skill for each team. This
naive approach smoothes out each skill point; for example,
there is only one goalie but other players” goal keeping skill
make the difference small. Thus we need to sum up the stats
according to the positions. To prevent smoothing out, we
selected a few number of top scores from each squad. We tried
several combinations of 2 ∼ 5 top scores for each feature. And
we ended up selecting [4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 1] top scores respectively.
Thus the one set of data looks as follows.

Team Virtual Features(team) =



(cid:80) top 4 Attacking, ∈ [0, 2000]
(cid:80) top 5 Skill, Movement,
(cid:80) top 4 Defending, ∈ [0, 1200]
(cid:80) top 1 Goalkeeping, ∈ [0, 500]

Power, Mentality, ∈ [0, 2500]

An on-ﬁeld player is represented as a set of 33 features
which are split into 6 main categories Table I. A goalkeeper
is represented as a set of 5 features. A squad is given as a
set of 11 players, one of which is a goalkeeper the other 10
are usually split into a defensive group and a offensive group.
The aggregation function for team is computed by taking all the
goalkeeper features and averaging the ﬁeld players features ac-
cording by averaging top 4 Attacking and Defending, top 5 Skill,
Movement, Power, Mentality features fromTable I The rationale
behind this is that 1) goalkeepers features must be present in
the aggregation because there is only one goalkeeper per team,
2) There are usually 4 defenders so it makes sense to only
consider top 4 purely defensive skills. The other coefﬁcients
were approximated by trying a set of different combinations
and choosing the one that produces best hit rates.

1) Match result: For each match, there are three outcomes:
home team win, draw, and away team win. From the raw data,
home team score and away team score, we converted them into
binary values of three categories. For example, if home team
score > away team score, home team win=1 and rest of them
are 0.

2) Feature selection: To ﬁnd out which features are more
relevant, we also conducted a feature selection over the data.
We tried two feature selection algorithms: sequential forward
selection, and best ﬁrst selection. From the former,
top 5
features were home team skill, home team movement, home

team mentality, home team defence, home team goalkeeping.
And from the latter, top 5 features were home team attacking
, home team skill, home team movement, hometeam mentality,
home team goalkeeping. With SVM, the accuracy of prediction
from them was almost similar to ones that used the entire feature
set.

IV. MODELS AND RESULTS(SUPERVISED LEARNING)
We treated each match played between a home and an away
team as a sample which is labeled as (home win, draw, away
win). Notice that in soccer there are three possible outcomes
for each game but most of our classiﬁers have binary outputs.
We overcome this issue by slightly redeﬁning the problem we
are trying: we will have three binary classiﬁcation problems
where in each one we try to distinguish between on of the
labels and the other two.

which is a 24 dimensional vector. We applied Logistic
Regression and Linear SVM to predict labeling of each match.
We experimented with the feature set, by only looking at the
teams performance in the last 3 matches in order to capture the
“current form” of the team but the hit rate was not affected. We
achieved hit rate of around .75(Table I) which is comparable to
results in related works and is a good baseline for our “Virtual
Predictor”.

applied Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Logistic
Regression, SGD and Multivariate NB(we were required to
discretize our values for this model). The “Virtual Predictor”
produced results comparable to the “Real Predictor” and with
a little bit of tuning Linear SVM performed better(Table 1).

V. IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES(UNSUPERVISED LEARNING)
Soccer managers are responsible for developing a team strat-
egy before each match in order to surprise the opponent. Strat-
egy includes things like player positioning, tactics, set pieces,
etc. But team strategy is very often predicted by the sports-
reporters by just examining the squad before the game. The
reason this can be done is because managers trying to play an
offensive strategy will have to include a lot of offensive players
in the squad and visa versa. We take advantage of this property

collected from a video game(FIFA 2015).

Our results were comparable and in some places better than
results achieved by predictors that used real data. We also use
the data provided for each player and the players present in the
squad, to analyze the team strategy. Based on our analysis, we
were able to suggest better strategies for weak teams

I. INTRODUCTION

Sports betting has motivated many machine learning and rule
based attempts to solve this problem over the years but one of
the most common approaches was using some combination of
previous match results as a feature set. In this paper we attempt
a novel approach to Soccer Match Prediction that doesn’t use
match statistics. This, as far as we know, is the ﬁrst attempt to
predict soccer match outcomes using only “Virtual Data”(Video
game data). Our goal is to build a better or at least comparable
predictor than the ones based on “Real Data” which will verify
our hypothesis about the validity of video game data.

Video games have long become a multi-billion dollar industry
for a reason none other than the fact that they are really “good”.
And the reason they have become so good is because a lot
of resources have been spent on making them as realistic as
possible which requires collecting and curating a lot of real
world data. Of course this data has been collected for the sole
purpose of making the video simulation more realistic, thus
more engaging for the user. A representative of the a soccer
video game company said , “The information gathered by our
network of more than 1,300 scouts around the world, combined
with Prozone”s amazing performance data, makes this an in-
valuable tool for any football club that takes player recruitment
seriously”. If this statement is true, and the video games are
that accurate the question becomes: Can data collected by video
games be used for solving other problems in the same medium?
In this paper, we try to answer exactly this question.

The medium we looked at is European soccer and the video
game considered is “FIFA 2015”. Makers of this video game are
famous for creating the most realistic soccer player avatars that
look and act very much like real ones. In order to provide this
level of authenticity, experts have been hired to collect informa-
tion about the playing style of each player and curate this data so
that each player can be accurately represented as a combination
of 33+ features. This features include both physical(speed,
power, acceleration, etc) and technical skills(dribbling, heading,
accuracy, etc) represented as an integer from 1 to 100. These
features are updated constantly as the form of players change

over the season. It is interesting to point out that this data is
already being used to solve other problems - Scouts in English
Premiere League use video games to look for young, promising
players with speciﬁc skills.1. And not too long ago a video game
player was appointed as a general manager for a real soccer
team2.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
section 2 & 3 we describe the data sources for this project
and preprocessing. Section 4 describes our model selection for
match prediction and results. In section 5 we used unsupervised
learning techniques to identify the strategy used by the teams
based on their squads.

A. Previous Work

Sports prediction is obviously a very hot topic and has always
packed the interest of sports fans. Also, in countries where sports
betting is legal, sports prediction is as critical as predicting
stock prices. But despite this big interest in sports forecasting,
it was hard to ﬁnd serious published work on the subject. This
may be due to the fact that “Sports Prediction” is a bit too
far from academic interest. We were able to ﬁnd a few papers
from published in Economics journal. One paper [3] tried the
multi-layer perceptron for sports prediction, and explains how
hard it is predicting sports games. [4] investigated three other
prediction methods and compared their accuracy. Their result
shows that market prediction and betting odds provide much
better forecasts than tipsters. [2] anaylized a sports prediction
market of the FIFA World Cup 2006, and compared their
prediction accuracy based on history to a random draw. The
paper shows that history based prediction is better than a random
prediction.

Interestingly, it is more easy to ﬁnd many sprouts prediction
papers from other machine learning classes. Students tried to
predict their favorite sports game using machine learning. Many
different prediction algorithms have been used but they all had
one thing in common: they tried to predict match outcomes
based on previous match results. We didn’t ﬁnd any attempts at
strategy analysis or any instance of unsupervised learning. This
is mainly due to the limitation of their feature sets (previous
game history), they can only have small number of features.
And small number of features hide many factors of games. Thus
they could use only a small part of Machine Learning.

II. DATASET

In this project, we looked at games played in Spanish ‘La
Liga’(Primera Liga). There are 20 teams in the league who
play each other in a round-robin fashion twice(A plays B twice,
once at home and once away) which adds up to 380 ﬁxtures a
year. For this project, we aquired collection of data from three
different sources:

1) Fixture results

This represents the results of the played matches of ‘La
Liga’. It corresponds to the output variable in the pre-
diction algorithm. The scores where reduced to a binary
value of three categories: home win/draw/away win. Also
we collected line ups for each match. We focused on line
ups not teams, because teams tend to use different line
ups depending on strategy.
They were gathered from http://www.goal.com by script-
ing web-crawlers.

2) Real Data

3) Virtual Data

This data represents statistics about teams performance
from match history: goals, shots on target, yellow cards,
etc. We have looked at many examples of sports prediction
techniques and they all use data similar to this. This data
was used in this project to create a create a baseline
prediction algorithm that our new technique(using virtual
data) can be compared against.

This data was collected from http://soﬁfa.com, and repre-
sents 33 features for each players set by experts. Each
feature corresponds to a physical or technical skill of
player and is an integer value ranging (1, 100). These
are the features used by the video game to simulate the
actions of each player and in this paper we try to verify
how legitimate this data is, by training the predictor with it
and comparing the results to the predictor that uses “Real
Data”. The full set of “Virtual Features” can be found in
Table I.

Notice that Real Data and Virtual Data represent features for
the same output variables in Fixture results.

III. FEATURES AND PREPROCESSING

A. PCA

Sanity Check with PCA - “Virtual Data” was collected from
soﬁfa.com using web-crawlers, and represents a 33 feature
vecotor for each player in the league(total of 280 players).
Our hypothesis was that this data was sufﬁcient to build a
legitimate predictor for real match results but before we would

rated chuck of players are the goalkeepers.

start creating models and training we decided to do a basic
“sanity check”. Being familiar with the league and some of the
players we wanted to see if the scores given to the players are
consistent and are able to distinguish different type of players
from each other. In order to make the manual comparison of
280 players in 33 dimensional feature space more feasible we
applied PCA. This was a successful and a rather interesting use
of PCA, because by reducing the dimensions of the data to 3D(a
visually observable space) we could actually look at our data
and do a basic sanity check. First thing we noticed after plotting
the results of PCA(Figure 1) was a small set of points separated
from the rest. We checked and these points correspond to all
the goalkeepers in the league which is very intuitive because
soccer goalkeepers require a very different from set of skills
from ﬁeld players. Examining the results in Figure 1 further we
noticed that the top two players of the league ended up next to
each other on the 3D plot. In fact, in the reduced dimensional
space, it was easy to see that the players that are close to each
other are similar and the ones that are far away are not. We then
ran k-means clustering on the data and got three distinct groups
(Defensive Players, Offensive Players, Goalkeepers).

B. Real Data

“Real Data”collected from http://www.football-data.co.uk
represetns a set of 380 matches played between 20 teams.
Each match entry has 24 different statistics(home red cards,
away red cards, home team shots on target, etc). This data is
used to create a baseline predictor that our “virtual” predictor
can be compared against. The aggregation function basically
averages teams performance statistics over all the other matches.

Team Stat = (Home Team Shots, Away Team Shots,

..., Away Team Red Cards)

Team Real Features(Team)i = 1
m

m(cid:80)

j=1

Team Stats(Team)i

Team Stat represents 12 statistics for a team for a given
match. Team Real Features is computed by averaging this stats
for all the other matches it has played in.

C. Virtual Data

“Virtual Data”represents individual soccer players but we
want
to predict an outcome of a match played between
two squads(a squad consists of 11 players). We deﬁne an
aggregation function that represents a squad as a combination
of the features of the players it consists of. First, we just
calculated average values of each skill for each team. This
naive approach smoothes out each skill point; for example,
there is only one goalie but other players” goal keeping skill
make the difference small. Thus we need to sum up the stats
according to the positions. To prevent smoothing out, we
selected a few number of top scores from each squad. We tried
several combinations of 2 ∼ 5 top scores for each feature. And
we ended up selecting [4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 1] top scores respectively.
Thus the one set of data looks as follows.

Team Virtual Features(team) =



(cid:80) top 4 Attacking, ∈ [0, 2000]
(cid:80) top 5 Skill, Movement,
(cid:80) top 4 Defending, ∈ [0, 1200]
(cid:80) top 1 Goalkeeping, ∈ [0, 500]

Power, Mentality, ∈ [0, 2500]

An on-ﬁeld player is represented as a set of 33 features
which are split into 6 main categories Table I. A goalkeeper
is represented as a set of 5 features. A squad is given as a
set of 11 players, one of which is a goalkeeper the other 10
are usually split into a defensive group and a offensive group.
The aggregation function for team is computed by taking all the
goalkeeper features and averaging the ﬁeld players features ac-
cording by averaging top 4 Attacking and Defending, top 5 Skill,
Movement, Power, Mentality features fromTable I The rationale
behind this is that 1) goalkeepers features must be present in
the aggregation because there is only one goalkeeper per team,
2) There are usually 4 defenders so it makes sense to only
consider top 4 purely defensive skills. The other coefﬁcients
were approximated by trying a set of different combinations
and choosing the one that produces best hit rates.

1) Match result: For each match, there are three outcomes:
home team win, draw, and away team win. From the raw data,
home team score and away team score, we converted them into
binary values of three categories. For example, if home team
score > away team score, home team win=1 and rest of them
are 0.

2) Feature selection: To ﬁnd out which features are more
relevant, we also conducted a feature selection over the data.
We tried two feature selection algorithms: sequential forward
selection, and best ﬁrst selection. From the former,
top 5
features were home team skill, home team movement, home

team mentality, home team defence, home team goalkeeping.
And from the latter, top 5 features were home team attacking
, home team skill, home team movement, hometeam mentality,
home team goalkeeping. With SVM, the accuracy of prediction
from them was almost similar to ones that used the entire feature
set.

IV. MODELS AND RESULTS(SUPERVISED LEARNING)
We treated each match played between a home and an away
team as a sample which is labeled as (home win, draw, away
win). Notice that in soccer there are three possible outcomes
for each game but most of our classiﬁers have binary outputs.
We overcome this issue by slightly redeﬁning the problem we
are trying: we will have three binary classiﬁcation problems
where in each one we try to distinguish between on of the
labels and the other two.

which is a 24 dimensional vector. We applied Logistic
Regression and Linear SVM to predict labeling of each match.
We experimented with the feature set, by only looking at the
teams performance in the last 3 matches in order to capture the
“current form” of the team but the hit rate was not affected. We
achieved hit rate of around .75(Table I) which is comparable to
results in related works and is a good baseline for our “Virtual
Predictor”.

discretize our values for this model). The “Virtual Predictor”
produced results comparable to the “Real Predictor” and with
a little bit of tuning Linear SVM performed better(Table 1).

V. IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES(UNSUPERVISED LEARNING)
Soccer managers are responsible for developing a team strat-
egy before each match in order to surprise the opponent. Strat-
egy includes things like player positioning, tactics, set pieces,
etc. But team strategy is very often predicted by the sports-
reporters by just examining the squad before the game. The
reason this can be done is because managers trying to play an
offensive strategy will have to include a lot of offensive players
in the squad and visa versa. We take advantage of this property

and attempt to use unsupervised machine learning techniques to
identify different types of strategies based solely on the players
skills present in the each squad. “Fixture results” collected from
http://www.goal.com also includs the squads that were played
in each match. We deﬁne an aggregation function similar to
Team Virtual Rating, but notice that this function identiﬁes
strength of the team not the strategy. In order to identify strategy
we need to normalize the features in Team Virtual Rating.

A. Preprocessing

Normalization is required for k-mean clustering, because
Team Virtual Features for top teams are likely to be higher
than the ones for weaker teams in every aspect - they will have
better defense, offense, etc. But we normalize these features
by making sure that all the scores in Team Virtual Features
adds up to 1. Thus the value for each feature in Squad Strategy
will be represented in proportion to all
the other features
in the composition. This will allow us to observe if one of
the features is overemphasized which will deﬁne the strat-
egy. For example, a weak team and a very strong team may
have different Team Virtual Ratings but they may have similar
Squad Strategy if they are playing a similar strategy.

Squad Strategy= Normalized(Team Virtual Features)

Thus we can see that which skill is emphasized and which is
not in a certain combination. We assume that this emphasis of
skills reﬂects the strategy of the squad.

B. Clustering results

We computed Squad Strategy for each squad played in the
380 matches of the season. We then applied k-means clustering
to the data to identify distinct types of strategies with various
number of k. Figure 1 shows the root mean square error of k-
mean clustering for different number of k. Even though larger
k shows better ﬁt, if k is too large, it would be meaningless.
From the RMSE plot, 5 or 6 will be appropriate number for k.
Thus rest of analysis based on 5-mean clustering.

Figure2 shows the 5-mean clustering. Each cluster shows
distinct combinations: cluster0 is well balanced except
the
attacking, cluster1 is more focus on attacking and individual
skills, cluster2 is more biased on defending and movement,
cluster3 is focusing on goalkeeping and individual skills, and
cluster4 concentrates on goalkeeping and defending.

Fig. 2: K-mean RMSE

C. Clustering analysis

Given 5-mean clustering result, we analyzed winning odds
between clusters. Hence we can see which combination, i.e.
strategy, is more plausible in certain situations.

1) Winning odds between clusters: General winning odds
between clusters are given in Table III. Winning odds are
very different depending on the opponent and stadium. But
in general, cluster4 does well. Since the table shows winning
probability of home team, positive numbers are good for rows,
and negative numbers are good for columns.

However, Table III shows winning odds regardless of actual
point differences. That means cluster4 may have more strong
teams. Thus we also conducted analysis for weak teams; weak
teams mean teams with less stat points than the opponent.
TableIV shows winning cluster. This table shows cluster3 and
cluster4 are good strategy for weak team in general: cluster3 can
win against 1,2,and 3, and cluster4 can win against 0,1,and 3.
Thus if a certain team is weaker than the opponent, it is better
to focus on goalkeeping and defense to increase the winning
odds like cluster3 and cluster4.

Abstract—Our hypothesis is that the video game industry, in
the attempt to simulate a realistic experience, has inadvertently

collected from a video game(FIFA 2015).

match. Team Real Features is computed by averaging this stats
for all the other matches it has played in.

C. Virtual Data

“Virtual Data”represents individual soccer players but we
want
to predict an outcome of a match played between
two squads(a squad consists of 11 players). We deﬁne an
aggregation function that represents a squad as a combination
of the features of the players it consists of. First, we just
calculated average values of each skill for each team. This
naive approach smoothes out each skill point; for example,
there is only one goalie but other players” goal keeping skill
make the difference small. Thus we need to sum up the stats
according to the positions. To prevent smoothing out, we
selected a few number of top scores from each squad. We tried
several combinations of 2 ∼ 5 top scores for each feature. And
we ended up selecting [4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 1] top scores respectively.
Thus the one set of data looks as follows.

Team Virtual Features(team) =



(cid:80) top 4 Attacking, ∈ [0, 2000]
(cid:80) top 5 Skill, Movement,
(cid:80) top 4 Defending, ∈ [0, 1200]
(cid:80) top 1 Goalkeeping, ∈ [0, 500]

Power, Mentality, ∈ [0, 2500]

An on-ﬁeld player is represented as a set of 33 features
which are split into 6 main categories Table I. A goalkeeper
is represented as a set of 5 features. A squad is given as a
set of 11 players, one of which is a goalkeeper the other 10
are usually split into a defensive group and a offensive group.
The aggregation function for team is computed by taking all the
goalkeeper features and averaging the ﬁeld players features ac-
cording by averaging top 4 Attacking and Defending, top 5 Skill,
Movement, Power, Mentality features fromTable I The rationale
behind this is that 1) goalkeepers features must be present in
the aggregation because there is only one goalkeeper per team,
2) There are usually 4 defenders so it makes sense to only
consider top 4 purely defensive skills. The other coefﬁcients
were approximated by trying a set of different combinations
and choosing the one that produces best hit rates.

1) Match result: For each match, there are three outcomes:
home team win, draw, and away team win. From the raw data,
home team score and away team score, we converted them into
binary values of three categories. For example, if home team
score > away team score, home team win=1 and rest of them
are 0.

2) Feature selection: To ﬁnd out which features are more
relevant, we also conducted a feature selection over the data.
We tried two feature selection algorithms: sequential forward
selection, and best ﬁrst selection. From the former,
top 5
features were home team skill, home team movement, home

team mentality, home team defence, home team goalkeeping.
And from the latter, top 5 features were home team attacking
, home team skill, home team movement, hometeam mentality,
home team goalkeeping. With SVM, the accuracy of prediction
from them was almost similar to ones that used the entire feature
set.

IV. MODELS AND RESULTS(SUPERVISED LEARNING)
We treated each match played between a home and an away
team as a sample which is labeled as (home win, draw, away
win). Notice that in soccer there are three possible outcomes
for each game but most of our classiﬁers have binary outputs.
We overcome this issue by slightly redeﬁning the problem we
are trying: we will have three binary classiﬁcation problems
where in each one we try to distinguish between on of the
labels and the other two.

Team Real Features(TeamA),
Team Real Features(TeamB)
which is a 24 dimensional vector. We applied Logistic
Regression and Linear SVM to predict labeling of each match.
We experimented with the feature set, by only looking at the
teams performance in the last 3 matches in order to capture the
“current form” of the team but the hit rate was not affected. We
achieved hit rate of around .75(Table I) which is comparable to
results in related works and is a good baseline for our “Virtual
Predictor”.

applied Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Logistic
Regression, SGD and Multivariate NB(we were required to
discretize our values for this model). The “Virtual Predictor”
produced results comparable to the “Real Predictor” and with
a little bit of tuning Linear SVM performed better(Table 1).

V. IDENTIFYING STRATEGIES(UNSUPERVISED LEARNING)
Soccer managers are responsible for developing a team strat-
egy before each match in order to surprise the opponent. Strat-
egy includes things like player positioning, tactics, set pieces,
etc. But team strategy is very often predicted by the sports-
reporters by just examining the squad before the game. The
reason this can be done is because managers trying to play an
offensive strategy will have to include a lot of offensive players
in the squad and visa versa. We take advantage of this property

and attempt to use unsupervised machine learning techniques to
identify different types of strategies based solely on the players
skills present in the each squad. “Fixture results” collected from
http://www.goal.com also includs the squads that were played
in each match. We deﬁne an aggregation function similar to
Team Virtual Rating, but notice that this function identiﬁes
strength of the team not the strategy. In order to identify strategy
we need to normalize the features in Team Virtual Rating.

A. Preprocessing

Normalization is required for k-mean clustering, because
Team Virtual Features for top teams are likely to be higher
than the ones for weaker teams in every aspect - they will have
better defense, offense, etc. But we normalize these features
by making sure that all the scores in Team Virtual Features
adds up to 1. Thus the value for each feature in Squad Strategy
will be represented in proportion to all
the other features
in the composition. This will allow us to observe if one of
the features is overemphasized which will deﬁne the strat-
egy. For example, a weak team and a very strong team may
have different Team Virtual Ratings but they may have similar
Squad Strategy if they are playing a similar strategy.

Squad Strategy= Normalized(Team Virtual Features)

Thus we can see that which skill is emphasized and which is
not in a certain combination. We assume that this emphasis of
skills reﬂects the strategy of the squad.

B. Clustering results

We computed Squad Strategy for each squad played in the
380 matches of the season. We then applied k-means clustering
to the data to identify distinct types of strategies with various
number of k. Figure 1 shows the root mean square error of k-
mean clustering for different number of k. Even though larger
k shows better ﬁt, if k is too large, it would be meaningless.
From the RMSE plot, 5 or 6 will be appropriate number for k.
Thus rest of analysis based on 5-mean clustering.

Figure2 shows the 5-mean clustering. Each cluster shows
distinct combinations: cluster0 is well balanced except
the
attacking, cluster1 is more focus on attacking and individual
skills, cluster2 is more biased on defending and movement,
cluster3 is focusing on goalkeeping and individual skills, and
cluster4 concentrates on goalkeeping and defending.

Fig. 2: K-mean RMSE

C. Clustering analysis

Given 5-mean clustering result, we analyzed winning odds
between clusters. Hence we can see which combination, i.e.
strategy, is more plausible in certain situations.

1) Winning odds between clusters: General winning odds
between clusters are given in Table III. Winning odds are
very different depending on the opponent and stadium. But
in general, cluster4 does well. Since the table shows winning
probability of home team, positive numbers are good for rows,
and negative numbers are good for columns.

However, Table III shows winning odds regardless of actual
point differences. That means cluster4 may have more strong
teams. Thus we also conducted analysis for weak teams; weak
teams mean teams with less stat points than the opponent.
TableIV shows winning cluster. This table shows cluster3 and
cluster4 are good strategy for weak team in general: cluster3 can
win against 1,2,and 3, and cluster4 can win against 0,1,and 3.
Thus if a certain team is weaker than the opponent, it is better
to focus on goalkeeping and defense to increase the winning
odds like cluster3 and cluster4.

VI. DISCUSSION

In this section we described two approaches to soccer match
prediction: “Real Predictor” and “Virtual Predictor”. The “Real
Predictor” represents the traditional approach which applies
machine learning to match statistics collected throughout the
season(we refer to this as “Real Data”). This approach achieved

of soccer players, but its likely that they have used more than 33
features, which are presented in the game, to accomplish this.
We believe that if the entire feature set was available, “Virtual
Predictor” would achieve even higher hit rates.

0.75 hit rate for our data but we looked at related work and the
highest hit rate achieved with this approach was 0.83[1]. “Virtual
Predictor”, which uses only data collected from video games,
achieved 0.80 hit rate. This demonstrates that data collected by
the video-game industry can be used to solve real problems in
this medium, soccer, with comparable or even better results.

B. Unsupervised Learning

In this section we were able to use k-means clustering to
identify 5 different types of playing strategies based on the
players skills present in the squad(Figure 3). We were able
to measure how these 5 different strategies perform against
each other and observed that most top teams in Soccer have
very offensive strategies. This is in contrast to NBA, where
best teams where the ones with good defensive stats[1]. Also
we observed that weaker teams perform better against stronger
teams if they use defensive strategies.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

One of the main challenges in machine learning projects
is data collection which can be very time consuming and
expensive. In this paper we demonstrate an alternative sources
for curated data: video games. Video games are often overlooked
due to its origin. However, video games have come a long
way since Pac-Man and Frogger and have created phenomenally
accurate simulations of the real world, which can only be done
through very intensive data collection. This data can be used in
machine learning projects to make predictions in the real world
with very accurate results. Of course this would be made easier
if the video game industry shared this information in public
domain. FIFA 2015 has done a great job simulating the action
