Bayes  and  Softmax  regression,  we  classified  the  prices  into  five  bins  using  three  different 
classification methods, and the target variable would be 1 to 5, representing each bin. For SVM, 
the prices are classified using equal interval.

are able to achieve an accuracy of 60.54%, which is not very ideal. However, when using only two

problem. Since Naïve Bayes is computational efficient and gives reasonable results when

to investigate further.

We  divided  prices  into  several  bins  according  to  their  relative  values  compared  to  the  overall 
average air ticket price. An example set of bins would be 60% to 80%, 80% to 100%, 100% to 
120% and 120% to 140% (of average price) etc. Using L2-regularization and L2 loss function, we 
are able to achieve an accuracy of 60.54%, which is not very ideal. However, when using only two 
bins (higher and lower than average), we are able to achieve an accuracy of 80.6%. 
SVM regression has also been used as a continuous model, which does not generate satisfying 
results, thus discarded.  
 
Result and Discussion 
We selected the price of the round trip between New York Airport and Charles de Gaulle Airport 
to test the performance of the model developed, applying leave out one cross validation. There are 
9390 data points included in the testing dataset.

Naïve Bayes 

For weighted linear regression, when the bandwidth value is large (𝜏=10), the hypothesis is 

Softmax Regression 

SVM(two bins) 

 

closer to the one of unweighted linear regression; the errors of these two cases are almost the 
same. In addition, not surprisingly, the smaller the bandwidth value is, the better the prediction 
fits the training data, and the smaller the training error would be.  
 
In order to reduce the training error, we utilized learning curve to investigate the price prediction 
problem. Since Naïve Bayes is computational efficient and gives reasonable results when 
classifying 5 bins, and SVM gives the lowest error when classifying only 2 bins, we picked them 
to investigate further.

From the plots above, it is apparent that both models have high biases, indicating adding more 
features will help reduce the error. Due to the limited accessible information from price-quoting 
websites, we are only able to add the count of itineraries from all airlines to our features, and we 
found that the training error of Naïve Bayes and Softmax regression reduced to 24.88% and 
20.22%, respectively. Similarly, the error of SVM model is also reduced by approximately 1%. 
Ideally, if we could have access to information such as number of seats on airplane or number of 
vacant seats etc., we would be able to predict the price much better. Still, we could have gathered 
information such as the departure time of the day to improve the accuracy of our model. But 
these information is not included in the dataset from Professor Gini and given the limited time of 
this project, we are unable to collect enough amount of data. 
In addition to adding new features, we also study the performance of our model in each 
individual bin. The results showed that Naïve Bayes only misclassifies data in the first bin 
(lowest price interval), with a training error of 36.40%. This means Naive Bayes is quite reliable 
in all other price intervals except the lowest one. 
 
Conclusion 
This study shows that it is feasible to predict the airline ticket price based on historical data. One 
possible way to increase the accuracy can be combining different models after carefully studying 
their own performance on each individual bin. Additionally, as the learning curve indicates, adding 
more  features  will  increase  the  accuracy  of  our  models.  However,  limited  by  the  current  data 
source that we have, we are unable to extract more information of a particular flight. In the future, 
more features, such as the available seat, the departure time of a day, and whether the departure 
day is a holiday or not, can be added to the model to improve the performance of the predicting 
model.
