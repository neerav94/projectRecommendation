Prediction of Airline Ticket Price

maximize  revenue,  based  on  proprietary  algorithms  and  hidden  variables.  Therefore,  it  is 
challenging for consumers to predict the price change in the future i. With the information of the 
airfare available online, buyers are trying to track the prices of the flight over a certain period of 
time, and anticipate the price change in the future. However, it turns out to be rather difficult to 
predict the price of the flight precisely only by observation.  
Our project is aimed at building up models to predict the airline ticket price. The input of our 
models are the factors that may influence the price, such as the weekday of departure and the 
number of stops in the itinerary. We applied linear regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Softmax regression, 
and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the corresponding price.

strategy data mining algorithm ‚Äì Hamlet generated a predictive model that could potentially save 
substantial amount of money which consumers pay on airline tickets. Groves et al.iv proposed a 
model to predict expected minimum price of all flights on a particular route. The model was also 
used to predict price with different target properties such as prediction from a specific flight, 
non-stop only flight and etc. Rama-Murthyii built a model to predict the airfare price with 
specific focus on how different factors influence the price of airline tickets. Papadakisiii studied 
how prices of airline tickets change overtime by extracting several factors that potentially affect

Methods  
Since the price of the flight varies due to the difference in distance, popularity of airport, and other

different models for each airline route and the model trained is only applicable to its corresponding 
route. For the continuous model, the target variable is simply the one-day-average price. For Na√Øve 
Bayes  and  Softmax  regression,  we  classified  the  prices  into  five  bins  using  three  different 
classification methods, and the target variable would be 1 to 5, representing each bin. For SVM, 
the prices are classified using equal interval.

To  convert  the  problem  to  a  classification  problem,  we  applied  three  different  discretization 
methods: equal probability discretization, equal interval discretization, and K-means cluster. We 
separated the relative price into five bins and selected the same features as the ones used in linear 
regression. Multinomial event model of Na√Øve Bayes with Laplace smoothing is applied to model 
the trend of the price. Several tests indicate that equal interval discretization method always gives 
the highest accuracy. Therefore, we decided to apply this method when developing Na√Øve Bayes 
model.

We  divided  prices  into  several  bins  according  to  their  relative  values  compared  to  the  overall

120% and 120% to 140% (of average price) etc. Using L2-regularization and L2 loss function, we 
are able to achieve an accuracy of 60.54%, which is not very ideal. However, when using only two 
bins (higher and lower than average), we are able to achieve an accuracy of 80.6%. 
SVM regression has also been used as a continuous model, which does not generate satisfying 
results, thus discarded.  
 
Result and Discussion

regression. Multinomial event model of Na√Øve Bayes with Laplace smoothing is applied to model 
the trend of the price. Several tests indicate that equal interval discretization method always gives 
the highest accuracy. Therefore, we decided to apply this method when developing Na√Øve Bayes 
model.

3. Softmax Regression 
Using the same discretization method of relative price described in Na√Øve Bayes model, we can 
also develop softmax regression model to predict the price. We have 

The parameters of softmax regression are updated based on the following equation:

4. SVM 
We  divided  prices  into  several  bins  according  to  their  relative  values  compared  to  the  overall 
average air ticket price. An example set of bins would be 60% to 80%, 80% to 100%, 100% to 
120% and 120% to 140% (of average price) etc. Using L2-regularization and L2 loss function, we 
are able to achieve an accuracy of 60.54%, which is not very ideal. However, when using only two 
bins (higher and lower than average), we are able to achieve an accuracy of 80.6%. 
SVM regression has also been used as a continuous model, which does not generate satisfying 
results, thus discarded.  
 
Result and Discussion 
We selected the price of the round trip between New York Airport and Charles de Gaulle Airport 
to test the performance of the model developed, applying leave out one cross validation. There are 
9390 data points included in the testing dataset.

Na√Øve Bayes 

For weighted linear regression, when the bandwidth value is large (ùúè=10), the hypothesis is 

Softmax Regression 

SVM(two bins) 

 

closer to the one of unweighted linear regression; the errors of these two cases are almost the 
same. In addition, not surprisingly, the smaller the bandwidth value is, the better the prediction 
fits the training data, and the smaller the training error would be.  
 
In order to reduce the training error, we utilized learning curve to investigate the price prediction 
problem. Since Na√Øve Bayes is computational efficient and gives reasonable results when 
classifying 5 bins, and SVM gives the lowest error when classifying only 2 bins, we picked them 
to investigate further.

From the plots above, it is apparent that both models have high biases, indicating adding more 
features will help reduce the error. Due to the limited accessible information from price-quoting 
websites, we are only able to add the count of itineraries from all airlines to our features, and we 
found that the training error of Na√Øve Bayes and Softmax regression reduced to 24.88% and 
20.22%, respectively. Similarly, the error of SVM model is also reduced by approximately 1%. 
Ideally, if we could have access to information such as number of seats on airplane or number of 
vacant seats etc., we would be able to predict the price much better. Still, we could have gathered 
information such as the departure time of the day to improve the accuracy of our model. But 
these information is not included in the dataset from Professor Gini and given the limited time of 
this project, we are unable to collect enough amount of data. 
In addition to adding new features, we also study the performance of our model in each 
individual bin. The results showed that Na√Øve Bayes only misclassifies data in the first bin 
(lowest price interval), with a training error of 36.40%. This means Naive Bayes is quite reliable 
in all other price intervals except the lowest one. 
 
Conclusion 
This study shows that it is feasible to predict the airline ticket price based on historical data. One 
possible way to increase the accuracy can be combining different models after carefully studying 
their own performance on each individual bin. Additionally, as the learning curve indicates, adding 
more  features  will  increase  the  accuracy  of  our  models.  However,  limited  by  the  current  data 
source that we have, we are unable to extract more information of a particular flight. In the future, 
more features, such as the available seat, the departure time of a day, and whether the departure 
day is a holiday or not, can be added to the model to improve the performance of the predicting 
model.
