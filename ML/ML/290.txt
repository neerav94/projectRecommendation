Introduction

Conceptual design and performance estimation for aircraft is a complex multi-disciplinary problem that
involves modelling the eﬀects of the aerodynamics, propulsion, stability and structural response of the aircraft
for a speciifed design mission. However, for applications like simulation of the ﬂights across the entire airspace
as shown in Fig 1, it becomes necessary to model tens of thousands of aircraft simultaneously making the
problem extremely computationally expensive. The goal of this project is to use aircraft performance data
to build surrogate models using diﬀerent regression techniques and observe which techniques are best suited
for the problem at hand. Once the surrogate is build, aircraft missions can be inexpensively simulated
using the surrogate thus allowing us to solve extremely large design problems involving thousands of designs
inexpensively.

II. Data and Features

The data used for this problem was obtained by performing simulations on a large number of aircraft
of diﬀerent sizes using a conceptual design code called the Program for Aircraft Synthesis Studies. These
simulation were performed a few months ago as part of a research project with the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration (FAA). The data set contains the performance estimates of about 48,000 diﬀerent aircraft
conﬁgurations at diﬀerent ﬂight conditions. Each data point originally contained 24 inputs and 8 outputs.
Of the outputs we are only interested in fuel burn for this project. Moreover, the input dimension is reduced
to 7 as described in section A. The 7 inputs (columns) that are fed into the diﬀerent regression models are
the aircraft payload, the mission range, the takeoﬀ weight, cruise Mach number, wing span, wing sweep and
the wing area. Each of these variables is non- dimensionalised to ensure that they remain between 0 and 1.
Table 1 shows a sample data point from the training data set. The data is used to create 6 training sets of
sizes 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 and 20000 samples and 4 test sets each with 4000 samples.

A feed-forward Multilayer Perceptron Network is the last method that has been applied to the data.
Work done by Bryan Yukto3 as part of his dissertation at MIT has shown that feed forward ANNs provide
promising results for prediction of aircraft parameters. We use a 3 layer network with 7 input neuron, 7
hidden neurons and 1 output neuron. The network used was arrived at by trying out diﬀerent 3 and 4 layer
networks by varying the number of hidden layers and neurons in these layers. We try both the sigmoid and
the hyperbolic tangent activation functions. For this study the tanh activation function performs better.
Morever, standard gradient descent based back propogation is unable to bring down the training error.
Thus a Levenberg Marquardt back propogation error is used for this study. In this method, the gradient g
is estimated using J T e where J is the jacobian matrix computed using back propogation as shown in the
references 1 and e is the error vector for the n training samples. The Hessian H is approximated using
J T J + νI . The weights are then updated using W := W − H−1g. Figure 4 shows the convergence history
of the network for the case with 1000 training samples. For the current study, we stop the training at 10000
iterations(as the error is already signiﬁcantly low. ANN’s are promising for the curent application as the
training and test error can be signiﬁcantly reduced even further by training for larger number of iterations
as shown by the trends. A python implementation of the multi-layer perceptron network algorithm along
with the diﬀerent back-propogation methods was written from scratch for this project.

Artificial Neural Network - Multilayer Perceptron Network

A feed-forward Multilayer Perceptron Network is the last method that has been applied to the data.
Work done by Bryan Yukto3 as part of his dissertation at MIT has shown that feed forward ANNs provide
promising results for prediction of aircraft parameters. We use a 3 layer network with 7 input neuron, 7
hidden neurons and 1 output neuron. The network used was arrived at by trying out diﬀerent 3 and 4 layer
networks by varying the number of hidden layers and neurons in these layers. We try both the sigmoid and
the hyperbolic tangent activation functions. For this study the tanh activation function performs better.
Morever, standard gradient descent based back propogation is unable to bring down the training error.
Thus a Levenberg Marquardt back propogation error is used for this study. In this method, the gradient g
is estimated using J T e where J is the jacobian matrix computed using back propogation as shown in the
references 1 and e is the error vector for the n training samples. The Hessian H is approximated using
J T J + νI . The weights are then updated using W := W − H−1g. Figure 4 shows the convergence history
of the network for the case with 1000 training samples. For the current study, we stop the training at 10000
iterations(as the error is already signiﬁcantly low. ANN’s are promising for the curent application as the
training and test error can be signiﬁcantly reduced even further by training for larger number of iterations
as shown by the trends. A python implementation of the multi-layer perceptron network algorithm along
with the diﬀerent back-propogation methods was written from scratch for this project.

We summarise the results described in the previous section by tabulating the testing and training error
obtained using the diﬀerent methods in table 3. The test error stated below are averaged values over the 4
test sets of 4000 samples each, for the training set of 1000 samples .

V. Conclusion

We see that machine learning techniques perform well in predicting aircraft performance. Gaussian
Process regression and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks are the most promising methods. GPR allows us to reduce
the prediction errors signiﬁcantly and the approximation improves as the number of samples is increased.
ANN’s also perform well and importantly as the number of training iterations are increased, the prediction
error can be reduced further. This is encouraging as now, millions of predictions can be performed in a
matter of seconds without resorting to parallel computation. This will allow designer to simulate large scale
aircraft systems like the National Airspace system accurately and perform optimizations on air transportation
networks (changing ﬂight paths and schedules) to try and minimize the overall fuel burn of the system without
worrying about computational costs.

Another interesting trend that jumps out is that simple methods like linear or quadratic regression also
work fairly well with estimation errors below 5%. This is encouraging as these methods can be used by people
with minimal machine learning experience in cases where quick estimates are required, without having to
worry about the complications of GPR or ANNs.

VI. Future Work

The studies for this case were all performed on conventional aircraft conﬁgurations. Looking to see if these
methods work for unconcentional aircraft conﬁgurations like Blended wing bodies etc. will be an interesting
next step. For those conﬁgurations, the interactions between the diﬀerent disciplines are extremely complex
and modelling them using regression methods might not work out as well as they did for this case.
