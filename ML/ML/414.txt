Moreover,  the  barred  center  of  barred  spirals

from 

it 

the 

barred spiral galaxies since the center of barred 
spiral  galaxies  will  have  high  ellipticity  as 
opposed  to  the  circular  centers  of  non-spiral 
galaxies. 

The next feature considered was the convexity of 
the bounding polygon of the galaxy, since non-
spiral  galaxies  will  be  bounded  by  an  ellipse 
whereas 
spiral  galaxies  will  often  have 
concavities in between their arms.  

The  mean  brightness  of  the  galaxy,  within  the 
bounding polygon was also added to the feature 
set  to  distinguish  spiral  galaxies  from  barred 
spiral  galaxies,  because  barred  spirals  have 
overall  lower  mean  brightness  since  they  have 
longer arms that stretch further from the center 
of the galaxy. 

Additionally,  the  ratio  of  white  to  black  pixels 
inside the bounding rectangle of the galaxy in the 
black  and  white 
image  was  selected.  We 
predicted that this feature would primarily serve 
as  way  to  separate  Spiral  galaxies  and  edge 
galaxies from the rest since they will have lower 
ratios of white to black pixels. 

The  ratio  of  the  perimeter  of  the  bounding 
polygon of the galaxy to the bounding ellipse of 
the galaxy was also used. Spiral galaxies will have 
highest  polygon  perimeter  since  they  are 
elliptical  with  many  concavities,  barred  spiral 
galaxies will be next since they generally have a 
large  concavity,  and  elliptical  and  lenticular 
galaxies will have the highest ratio of all. 

The  last  feature  we  employed  was  the  rBulge 
which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  shortest 
radius  at  which  the  brightness  has  dropped  to 
90% maximum brightness to the shortest radius 
to the edge of the galaxy [4]. Spiral galaxies and 
specifically  barred  spiral  galaxies  will  drop  in 
brightness quicker as gaps between arms allow 
the brightness to dip down abruptly.

The  models  that  we  used  were  Gaussian 
Discriminate  Analysis  and  Support  Vector 
Machines.    Gaussian  Discriminate  Analysis  was 
selected  as  our  experimental  model  in  this 
project. If features are Gaussian distributed this 
the  result  of  GDA  would  have  a very  low  error 
and perhaps an undiscovered optimal model to 
use for machine learning galaxy classification.  

Support  Vector  Machines  were  used  as  a 
reference  model  since  we  had  seen  many 
implementations that had succeeded with very 
low  error  [5].  The  previous  success  of  an  SVM 
implementation with various sets of parameters 
indicated  that  the  training  examples  were 
linearly separable. 

Lastly,  we  decided  to  take  a  fragmented 
approach  to  classifying  the  galaxies  to  better 
examine the utility of each of the morphological 
features at each stage in the process.

Abstract 

To solve the issue of galaxy morphological classification according to a classification scheme modelled 
off of the Hubble Sequence, we implement a pipeline of various machine learning algorithms including 

Support Vector Machines (SVM’s) and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA). We derived a set of 

features that we felt would best distinguish between the five classes of galaxies and used a forward 

search to find the optimal subset. Ultimately we found that the SVM performed significantly better than 

the GDA model at every step in the pipeline.

the 

barred spiral galaxies since the center of barred 
spiral  galaxies  will  have  high  ellipticity  as 
opposed  to  the  circular  centers  of  non-spiral 
galaxies. 

The next feature considered was the convexity of 
the bounding polygon of the galaxy, since non-
spiral  galaxies  will  be  bounded  by  an  ellipse 
whereas 
spiral  galaxies  will  often  have 
concavities in between their arms.  

The  mean  brightness  of  the  galaxy,  within  the 
bounding polygon was also added to the feature 
set  to  distinguish  spiral  galaxies  from  barred 
spiral  galaxies,  because  barred  spirals  have 
overall  lower  mean  brightness  since  they  have 
longer arms that stretch further from the center 
of the galaxy. 

Additionally,  the  ratio  of  white  to  black  pixels 
inside the bounding rectangle of the galaxy in the 
black  and  white 
image  was  selected.  We 
predicted that this feature would primarily serve 
as  way  to  separate  Spiral  galaxies  and  edge 
galaxies from the rest since they will have lower 
ratios of white to black pixels. 

The  ratio  of  the  perimeter  of  the  bounding 
polygon of the galaxy to the bounding ellipse of 
the galaxy was also used. Spiral galaxies will have 
highest  polygon  perimeter  since  they  are 
elliptical  with  many  concavities,  barred  spiral 
galaxies will be next since they generally have a 
large  concavity,  and  elliptical  and  lenticular 
galaxies will have the highest ratio of all. 

The  last  feature  we  employed  was  the  rBulge 
which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  shortest 
radius  at  which  the  brightness  has  dropped  to 
90% maximum brightness to the shortest radius 
to the edge of the galaxy [4]. Spiral galaxies and 
specifically  barred  spiral  galaxies  will  drop  in 
brightness quicker as gaps between arms allow 
the brightness to dip down abruptly.

The  models  that  we  used  were  Gaussian 
Discriminate  Analysis  and  Support  Vector 
Machines.    Gaussian  Discriminate  Analysis  was 
selected  as  our  experimental  model  in  this 
project. If features are Gaussian distributed this 
the  result  of  GDA  would  have  a very  low  error 
and perhaps an undiscovered optimal model to 
use for machine learning galaxy classification.  

Support  Vector  Machines  were  used  as  a 
reference  model  since  we  had  seen  many 
implementations that had succeeded with very 
low  error  [5].  The  previous  success  of  an  SVM 
implementation with various sets of parameters 
indicated  that  the  training  examples  were 
linearly separable. 

Lastly,  we  decided  to  take  a  fragmented 
approach  to  classifying  the  galaxies  to  better 
examine the utility of each of the morphological 
features at each stage in the process.

6 Discussion 

In  order  to  prevent  overfitting  and  the  use  of 
parameters that were not relevant for a specific 
classification  type,  we  used  forward  search 
feature selection to find the best features to use 
for each classification.  This usually resulted in 1-
3 features.  Of these, the mean brightness of the 
galaxy  and  the  ellipticity  of  the  center  of  the 
galaxy were the two parameters that seemed to 
be the most useful. 

Our  results  clearly  show  that  Support  Vector 
Machines are superior to Gaussian Discriminant 
Analysis 
for  galaxy  classification  with  our 

parameters.  Gaussian Discriminant Analysis had 
very  little  success,  usually  obtaining  training 
error in the range of 40 percent.  This shows that 
the  parameters  cannot  be  well  modeled  as 
Gaussian  with  the  morphological  features  that 
were  used.  Even  after  adjusting  the  amount  of 
features as well as the size of k in our kFold Cross 
Validation  from  10  to  both  5  and  20,  the  GDA 
failed to find a fit that was comparable to that of 
the  SVM.  Additionally,  the  fit  of  the  Support 
Vector  Machine  shows  that  the  features  we 
selected here were also linearly separable.

Abstract 

To solve the issue of galaxy morphological classification according to a classification scheme modelled 
off of the Hubble Sequence, we implement a pipeline of various machine learning algorithms including 

Support Vector Machines (SVM’s) and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA). We derived a set of 

features that we felt would best distinguish between the five classes of galaxies and used a forward 

search to find the optimal subset. Ultimately we found that the SVM performed significantly better than 

the GDA model at every step in the pipeline. 

 

1 Introduction 

a 

bottleneck 

the 

creating 

In  1936,  Edward  Hubble  developed  a 
classification  scheme  to  divide  galaxies  into 
distinct  categories  based  upon  morphological 
features.  This  system,  which  would  eventually 
become known as the Hubble Sequence, consists 
of  4  major  categories  of  galaxies:  Elliptical, 
Lenticular,  Barred  Spiral,  and  Spiral.  As 
technology has advanced and the sheer volume 
of data produced by telescopes have increased, 
a  large  number  of  galaxies  have  remained 
unclassified, 
in 
astronomical  research.  To  address  this  issue, 
projects  like  Galaxy  Zoo  have  attempted  to 
crowdsource 
process; 
however, this introduces a high degree of human 
error  since  the  average  participant  in  these 
projects  does  not  have  a  background 
in 
astronomy.  Moreover,  some  of  the  features 
depicted  are  virtually 
impossible  to  detect 
insofar as the image quality and angle at which 
the  pictures  can  be  taken  are  limited.  To  solve 
this  problem,  we  have  implemented  various 
machine  learning  algorithms  using  a  pipeline 
approach  to  include  only  the  most  relevant 
features  at  each  step 
in  the  classification 
process.  A  few  papers  have  been  published  on 
this  topic,  using  various  features  and  machine 
learning  techniques.  Our  implementation  looks 
to build off of these implementations and test a 

classification 

number of new parameters. Additionally, we are 
looking  to  test  the  efficacy  of  Gaussian 
Discriminant  Analysis,  which  has 
to  our 
knowledge not been applied to this problem. 

Figure 1. This depicts a few classic example galaxies in 
the four major categories of the Hubble Sequence 

 

2 Dataset 

The  dataset  consists  of  334  images  of  galaxies 
along  with  their  correct  classification  in  the 
Hubble Classification Scheme.  The images were 
found  by 
searching  Nasa’s  High  Energy 
Astrophysics  Science  Archive  Research  Center 
(HEASARC)  for  galaxies  that  were  given  a  New 
General  Catalogue 
Index 
Catalogue  identification  [1].    This  qualification 
was  included  because  in  order  to  be  given  an 
identification in these catalogues, these galaxies 
were  sure  to  have  at  least  relatively  clear 

identification  or 

pictures  and have  a definite  classification.    The 
first  334  galaxies  from  the  resulting  list  were 
selected  to  be  our  data.    The  images  were 
obtained by following the links from HEASARC to 
Digitized  Sky  Survey  images  of  each  galaxy 
provided by Skyview.  The correct classifications 
for  these  galaxies  were  then  discovered  by 
following the link to the Strasbourg Astronomical 
Data Center [2] [3]. 

3 Preprocessing and Features 

the 

images 

Before  we  extracted  any  features  from  the 
images,  we  preprocessed 
to 
normalize  our  training  and  test  data.    First, we 
filtered  out  all  the  background  noise,  primarily 
additional stars, by and blacking out everything 
outside  of  the  polygon  defined  by  the  contour 
with the largest arc length in the picture. Once 
the  stars  had  been  removed,  the  picture  was 
centered on the cluster of pixels with the highest 
mean  intensity  in  the  middle  fifth  column  and 
row  of  the  picture,  which  correlated  with  the 
center of the galaxy. Lastly the color images were 
converted to greyscale and black and white.

the preprocessing stage. 

used 

features 

For both of our models we  relied on a set of 9 
image features that took advantage of the three 
major  morphological 
to 
distinguish  galaxies  in  the  Hubble  Sequence: 
Bars,  Rings,  and  Spiral  Arms.  There  is  one  last 
thing  to  note  before  discussing  the  features; 
some of the pictures collected have been taken 
at  such  an  angle  that  their  morphological 
features  are  not  discernable.  This  has  been 
commonly adopted into a fifth category known 
as edge galaxies. 

The first of our features was the number of times 
the brightness oscillated moving from the center 
of  the  galaxy  to  the  edge  totaled  over  each 
cardinal direction. We defined an oscillation as a 
change  of  at  least  .03  in  mean  brightness 
between two adjacent 10x10 pixel  regions. We 
determined  that  should  be  useful  for  deciding 
between  non-spiral  (elliptical,  lenticular,  edge) 
and  spiral  galaxies  since  spiral  arms  will  cause 
oscillations. 

The next feature we calculated was the absolute 
value of the brightness change moving from the 
center of the galaxy to the edge. This feature was 
selected to assist in separating barred spiral and 
spiral galaxies since thicker spiral arms will have 
a steeper intensity gradient.  This complements 
the first feature by giving more weight to larger 
oscillations. 

Our  third  feature,  rotational  symmetry,  was 
chosen  to  distinguish  non-spiral  galaxies  from 
spiral  galaxies.  To  extract  this  feature,  we 
rotated the galaxy 180 degrees about its center. 
We  determined  that  this  feature  would  be 
helpful since elliptical galaxies should have a very 
high  degree  of  symmetry,  while  spirals  would 
have a large number of pixels in their spiral arms 
that  would  not  overlap.  Furthermore,  an  ideal 
barred spiral would fall somewhere in the middle 
of this spectrum due to the symmetry of the bar 
that characterizes these galaxies. 

The ellipticity of the brightest 90 percent area of 
the  galaxy,  was  calculated  by  analyzing  a  new 
black  and  white 
image  (derived  from  the 
greyscale image) with a threshold at 90% of the 
maximum brightness turned to black and white, 
fitting  an  ellipse  around  the  remaining  pixels. 
This  defining  feature  of  elliptical  and  lenticular 
galaxies 
spirals. 
Moreover,  the  barred  center  of  barred  spirals 
decides between barred spiral galaxies and non-

segregated 

from 

it 

the 

barred spiral galaxies since the center of barred 
spiral  galaxies  will  have  high  ellipticity  as 
opposed  to  the  circular  centers  of  non-spiral 
galaxies. 

The next feature considered was the convexity of 
the bounding polygon of the galaxy, since non-
spiral  galaxies  will  be  bounded  by  an  ellipse 
whereas 
spiral  galaxies  will  often  have 
concavities in between their arms.  

The  mean  brightness  of  the  galaxy,  within  the 
bounding polygon was also added to the feature 
set  to  distinguish  spiral  galaxies  from  barred 
spiral  galaxies,  because  barred  spirals  have 
overall  lower  mean  brightness  since  they  have 
longer arms that stretch further from the center 
of the galaxy. 

Additionally,  the  ratio  of  white  to  black  pixels 
inside the bounding rectangle of the galaxy in the 
black  and  white 
image  was  selected.  We 
predicted that this feature would primarily serve 
as  way  to  separate  Spiral  galaxies  and  edge 
galaxies from the rest since they will have lower 
ratios of white to black pixels. 

The  ratio  of  the  perimeter  of  the  bounding 
polygon of the galaxy to the bounding ellipse of 
the galaxy was also used. Spiral galaxies will have 
highest  polygon  perimeter  since  they  are 
elliptical  with  many  concavities,  barred  spiral 
galaxies will be next since they generally have a 
large  concavity,  and  elliptical  and  lenticular 
galaxies will have the highest ratio of all. 

The  last  feature  we  employed  was  the  rBulge 
which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  shortest 
radius  at  which  the  brightness  has  dropped  to 
90% maximum brightness to the shortest radius 
to the edge of the galaxy [4]. Spiral galaxies and 
specifically  barred  spiral  galaxies  will  drop  in 
brightness quicker as gaps between arms allow 
the brightness to dip down abruptly.

images. 

Normalizing and preprocessing our images more 
would be an important step forward in our work, 
yet a major undertaking.  A common obstacle in 
the  algorithm  came  from the  fact  that  galaxies 
that are not directly perpendicular to the Earth 
are  seen  at  an  inclination.    Thus,  the  images 
contain galaxies at various inclinations.  Circular 
spiral galaxies seen at an inclination will appear 
elliptical.    Since  a  number  of  our  parameters 
depend  upon  analyzing  the  ellipticity  of  the 
galaxy, the height and width of the galaxy, and 
the  density  of  pixels  in  an  area  and  these 
parameters  assume  that  the  galaxy  is  seen 
directly  perpendicular,  they  are  thrown  off  by 
these  inclined  galaxies.    In  order  to  solve  this 
problem,  the  perpendicular  view  of  these 
inclined  galaxies  would  need  to  be  projected 
from  their 
is  a  complicated 
procedure since it is difficult to tell if a galaxy is 
inclined, simply naturally very elliptic, or a barred 
spiral galaxy with only two short arms.  
 
Another problem that often arose was that the 
brightness and the size of galaxies in the images 
were  not  consistent.    Some  of  the  elliptical 
galaxies  took  up  the  entire  image  without 
including  any  of  the  dark  space  around  the 
galaxy,  while  other  images  had  an  expanse  of 
space  around  the  galaxy.    Our  features  that 
worked with the borders of the galaxy were hard 
to  implement  when  the  borders  of  the  galaxy 
were sometimes not found to be included in the 
picture.  Preprocessing that works to normalize 
the  maximum  and  minimum  brightness  in  the 
images  and  the  size  of  the  galaxy  within  the 
image would serve to remedy this problem.  
 
Lastly, despite having tested the applications of 
nine  different  parameters  in  separating  the 
types of galaxies, there are a number of others 

that  could  perhaps  be  useful  if  we  were  to 
implement them.  Some of these include spectral 
signature and light color (implemented by N. Ball 
in  Robust  Machine  Learning  Applied 
to 
Astronomical  Data  Sets)  [6],  and  photometric, 
texture, and spectral data available from Galaxy 
Zoo  (implemented  A.  Gauci  et  al.  in  Machine 
Learning  for  Galaxy  Morphology  Classification) 
[7].
