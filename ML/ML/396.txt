Currently, there are around 67,000 children in
the California foster care system. Foster care sys-
tem is a government run system in which a minor
is placed into an institution, group home, or a pri-
vate home. The reason a child enters the foster
care system may vary, including abuse and neglect
by or the death of the parents. The median stay in

The child can exit from foster care in diﬀerent
ways, and this project focuses on 4 main ones: re-
uniﬁcation with the primary family, adoption by
another family, aging out of foster care, and run-
ning away. This project aims to predict the exit
outcome based on the child’s health state, reasons
for being removed from the child’s immediate fam-
ily, and the length of stay in foster care.

This project is only a predictive exercise, and I
cannot claim any causalities. For instance, I found
that the number of days spent in foster care is im-
portant in predicting the exit outcome of a child.
However, I cannot claim that staying longer in fos-
ter care causes a child to exit one way or another.
There can be other unaccounted variables that im-
pact both the length of stay and the exit outcome,
such as the child’s personality. The fact that the
number of days is predictive of outcome exit is not
surprising when we consider that the outcomes in-
clude adoption and emancipation. Length of stay is
correlated with age, and the age of a child is highly
predictive whether the child ages out of the foster
care system or gets adopted.

Studies in social services have long been inter-
ested in how the placement experience and per-
sonal characteristics of a child aﬀect the child’s
well being. The main diﬃculties with the studies
are fully capturing the factors that can aﬀect the re-
sult, including both the myriad of observable and
unobservable variables. Hence, researchers cannot
easily recover the causal impact of foster care on
the child. For instance, simply comparing the out-
comes of children of children who spent time in
foster care with those that did not leads to biased
estimate. The diﬀerence in outcome can be par-
tially or fully explained by the pre-placement expe-
rience, such as the extent of the abuse that the child
suﬀered prior to entering. One method to address
this issue is to have more extensive data on both the
child’s placement and pre-placement situations, as
done in (Berger, Johnson, Bruch, James, & Rubin,
2009). The most convincing studies are (Doyle,
2007) and (Doyle, 2008), which uses the random
assignment of social workers to diﬀerent cases as
instrumental variables. They ﬁnd that putting chil-
dren whose cases are on the margin into foster care
result in worse child outcome, in terms of health
condition and criminal activities.

With the recent passage of Fostering Connec-
tion Act of 2008, which increased the beneﬁt to
the state child welfare services that the federal
government fund, there are longitudanol studies
looking at the outcomes of children out of foster
care. (Courtney, Charles, & Nathanael J. Okpych,
2014) has collected extensive surveys of the chil-
dren aged from 16.75 - 17.75 during the year of

children in the sample were more likely to skip a
grade and less likely to drop out of high school.

Data

The data comes from Adoption and Foster Care
Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). This
dataset is a case-level dataset on an annual ba-
sis, which means each observation pertains to one
child for a given ﬁscal reporting year.

I restricted the years from 2002 - 2007, and fo-
cused on the Los Angeles County. I wanted to ab-
stract away from cross county diﬀerences, which
include child welfare policies, income level, popu-
lation composition, and others. I chose the county
of LA because the foster care population of LA
county makes up over 60% of the foster care pop-
ulation in California. During this period in LA,
there were 9968 exits from foster care. Some ob-
servations had missing variables.
I discarded all
the observations that had at least one missing vari-
able, which yielded 9331 observations.

Labels

I focused my attention on 4 main ways in which
a child can exit from the foster care system: reuni-
ﬁciation with the family, adoption, emancipation
and runaways. Emancipation means that the child
has reached the age of 18 and can no longer stay
in the foster care system. The breakdown of the
exit outcomes is summarized in table 3. As we can
see, the sample is very unbalanced. Majority of the
children exit by reunifying with their parents, and
about a fourth is adopted. I will address this issue
of unbalanced classes in the estimation section.

Features (and feature selection)

The AFCARS dataset contains identiﬁable in-
formation of the child. The variables for each
observation may include the child’s ethnicity, set
of disabilities, reasons for removal from original
caretakers, and age. There are multiple features
for disabilities and reasons for removal, and each
is a binary variable with 1 indicating that such dis-
ability or removal reason is applicable and 0 oth-
erwise. The variables are not mutually exclusive,
which means multiple disabilities or reasons for re-
moval can be applied to a single child. Variables
for disability include mental retardation, visual im-
pairment, and physical disability. Reasons for re-
moval may include neglect, physical abuse, sexual
abuse, parental drug-abuse, parental alcohol abuse,
etc. In total, there are 5 variables that describe the
mental, emotional, and physical state of the child
when entering foster care, and 15 variables for the
reasons of removal.

To reduce the number of features, I performed
PCA on the 5 variables for the health state and 15
variables for the reason for removal. I tried to re-
duce the features to various number of dimensions,
but such processing did not yield much improve-
ment in prediction.

I also reduce the number of features by adding
up the binary values of certain features into a larger
integer value. A child can have more than one of
the 5 variables that describe the health of the child
can equal one, i.e the child suﬀers from both men-
tal retardation and visual impairment. Similarly,
the reason a child was removed from home may
include, neglect and physical abuse. The sum of
these binary values may summarize the severity of
a child’s disability or the severity for the reason
for removal. For instance, we might suspect that
the situation of a child who was removed for ne-
glect, physical abuse, and drug abuse by the parent
is more severe than a child who was removed only
for neglect. However, this feature reduction did
not improve the prediction performance either. In
fact, the performance worsened. This result indi-

of support vector classiﬁcation (SVC) implement
an one-versus-one algorithm. The algorithm con-
structs 4*3/2 = 6 classiﬁcation coeﬃcients, each
for the possible pairing of the 4 labels. When mak-
ing prediction, an example is predicted using ev-
ery one of the 6 classiﬁcation, and the class that
receives the most vote is predicted.

I tried 3 diﬀerent types of kernels: Gaussian, lin-
ear, and polynomial. The kernels are parametrized
as follows:

Gaussian : K(x, y) = exp(−γ|x − y|),
K(x, y) =< x, y >,
K(x, y) = (< x, y > +r)d,

As seen from the table above, the prediction
for reuniﬁcation is over represented. Even though
the actual proportion of reuniﬁcation is 64 %, that
class is predicted 86% of the time. This fact may
be driven by how unbalanced the training set is,
even with the diﬀerent weights for the diﬀerent
classes.

I then examine the incremental impact on the
testing set accuracy by removing each of the fea-
tures. The result is summarized below. I only in-
cluded features that had made at least 0.5 % diﬀer-
ence.

As shown by the table, the number of days spent
in foster care seems important in determining the
exit outcome of the child. For this project, I choose
to use class weights rather than discarding exam-
ples to balance the training set, because I would
have had to discard too much of the data that I had.
In the future, I will try to develop an algorithm that
randomly selects a subset of examples "emancipa-
tion," "reuniﬁcation," and "adoption."

, where Ci corresponds to the penalty assigned to
the ith example based on the class weight and n
is the number of examples. The python package
of support vector classiﬁcation (SVC) implement
an one-versus-one algorithm. The algorithm con-
structs 4*3/2 = 6 classiﬁcation coeﬃcients, each
for the possible pairing of the 4 labels. When mak-
ing prediction, an example is predicted using ev-
ery one of the 6 classiﬁcation, and the class that
receives the most vote is predicted.

I tried 3 diﬀerent types of kernels: Gaussian, lin-
ear, and polynomial. The kernels are parametrized
as follows:

Gaussian : K(x, y) = exp(−γ|x − y|),
K(x, y) =< x, y >,
K(x, y) = (< x, y > +r)d,

Linear :
Polynomial :

Below is a table that summarizes the accuracy of
the training and testing set accuracy for the diﬀer-
ent kernels: It does not seem that the kernel choice

As seen from the table above, the prediction
for reuniﬁcation is over represented. Even though
the actual proportion of reuniﬁcation is 64 %, that
class is predicted 86% of the time. This fact may
be driven by how unbalanced the training set is,
even with the diﬀerent weights for the diﬀerent
classes.

I then examine the incremental impact on the
testing set accuracy by removing each of the fea-
tures. The result is summarized below. I only in-
cluded features that had made at least 0.5 % diﬀer-
ence.

As shown by the table, the number of days spent
in foster care seems important in determining the
exit outcome of the child. For this project, I choose
to use class weights rather than discarding exam-
ples to balance the training set, because I would
have had to discard too much of the data that I had.
In the future, I will try to develop an algorithm that
randomly selects a subset of examples "emancipa-
tion," "reuniﬁcation," and "adoption."

fact that the length of stay was most important in
predicting the exit outcome may not be very infor-
mative. It is correlated with the age of the child,
which is correlated with whether a child ages out
or gets adopted.

Discussion

One major concern I have of the estimation is
the fact that the training set was very unbalanced.
Another weakness with the data set is that many
of the variables are binary rather than continuous
variables. For instance, I simply observe whether a
child suﬀers from mental retardation or visual im-
pairment. However, I do not observe the extent of
each of the condition. Hence, we do not know how
comparable one variable is to another. Lastly, the
