Introduction

Singapore is a small island-nation situated at the
tip of the Malay Peninsular in Southeast Asia. It
existed as a British colony from 1819 to 1959, in-
terspersed by a period of Japanese occupation from
1942 to 1945 during World War II. Throughout its
colonial history, Singapore has been the recipient of
extensive immigration from various parts of Asia,
and the same diversity is still reﬂected in Singa-
pore’s ethnic composition today.

As can be seen from Figure 1, three ethnic groups
constituted the majority of the migrant population
in British Singapore: the Chinese, the Malays, and
the Indians. Today, the population of Singapore
stands at 5.34 million, of which 3.87 million are res-
idents. Of the latter group, the racial breakdown
is as follows: 74.26% Chinese, 13.35% Malay, and
9.12% Indian (Department of Statistics, Singapore,
2014), reﬂecting a multicultural landscape that is
a legacy of the country’s history over the past two
centuries.

Yet, it likely that there exists uncharacterized sub-
structure within these three ethnic populations in
Singapore. Most Singaporean Chinese originated

from Southern China, but belong to various dialect
groups, likely representing diﬀerent ethnic groups.
India was at that time also a British colony. Immi-
grants from India to Singapore hailed mostly from
the southern part of the country, but with a signif-
icant minority (such as the Sikhs) coming from the
north as well.
It has also been found that many
Singaporean Indians have a higher fraction of Eu-
ropean ancestry as compared to native Indian pop-
ulations. Malays are the indigenous people of the
Malay Archipelago. The native Malays of the Sin-
gapore made up just a small proportion of the to-
tal Malay population on the island, the majority of
whom migrated from Malaya (now Malaysia) and
the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).

Characterizing the population substructure of Sin-
gapore can not only help illuminate its cultural his-
tory, it also has potential medical implications for
Singaporeans. For example, uncovering population
substructure could prevent spurious results in ge-
netic association studies for disease. While many
studies have previously explored the question of sub-
structure in a global context, few have done so on a
population that exists in such close geographic prox-

In a similar vein to the 1000 Genomes Project, the
Singapore Genome Variation Project (SGVP) aims
to provide a publicly-available resource for cata-
loging genetic variation within the Singaporean pop-
ulation, especially in the context of the three ma-
jor ethnic groups. The data can obtained online
at http://www.statgen.nus.edu.sg/~SGVP. Af-
ter some initial cleaning up, SGVP contains data
for a total 96 Chinese, 89 Malay, and 83 Indian in-
dividuals at about 1.5 million single nucleotide poly-
morphisms, or SNPs (Teo et al., 2009). SNPs, rep-
resenting a single base (A, C, G, T) change at a
single locus, is the most common way of measuring
variation within a genome.

In this project, we plan to ﬁrst apply several un-
supervised machine learning techniques on the SNP
data to see if we can reveal any underlying pop-
ulation structure. Using this information, we can
then also attempt to devise a prediction algorithm
that can classify an individual into the correct eth-
nic group based on his or her genetic data.

Methods

Data processing

The initial step of this project involves process-
ing the data into a format that is suitable for fur-
ther analysis. Since humans are diploid organisms,
SGVP has data on SNPs found on both copies of
each individual’s chromosomes. Thus, we have a to-
tal of 192 Chinese, 178 Malay, and 166 Indian hap-
lotypes. For each autosome (non-sex chromosome),
we ﬁrst identify and retain only the SNPs that can
be found in all three ethnic groups in order to en-
sure a common ground for comparison. The SNPs
are represented by 1’s and 0’s, where 1 denotes the
presence of a speciﬁc nucleotide base, and 0 denotes
the presence of an alternative base. Here, all the
SNPs are biallelic (only two possible variants exist).

We then concatenate all 22 autosomes into a sin-
gle long string consisting of a total 1,369,502 SNPs.
This is taken to be a single haplotype. Following
this, we want to compare the pairwise distances be-

tween all possible haplotype pairs by calculating a
distance matrix. The metric we choose to consider is
the Hamming distance, which is given by the num-
ber of loci at which the two haplotypes do not share
the same SNP, normalized by the total number of
SNPs. Mathematically, the Hamming distance H
between haplotypes a and b is

(cid:80)m
i=1 1{a[i] (cid:54)= b[i]}

,

Hab = Hba =

m

where in this case m = 1, 369, 502. For example,
the Hamming distance between two haplotypes that
have the same SNP at all loci is 0, whereas the Ham-
ming distance between two haplotypes that have dif-
ferent SNPs at all loci is 1.

Unsupervised learning methods

With the Hamming distance matrix calculated, we
can now proceed to apply some unsupervised learn-
ing techniques to further analyze the data. We ﬁrst
use k-medoids clustering (Kaufman & Rousseeuw,
1987) with k = 3 to see if haplotypes belonging
to the three ethnic groups can be correctly clus-
tered together. k-medoids clustering is conceptually
similar to k-means clustering, with the main diﬀer-
ence being that in the former, each cluster’s “center”
must be chosen from the original set of data points,
whereas there is no such restriction in the latter.
Here, we choose to use k-medoids instead of k-means
because the Hamming distance is a non-Euclidean
distance measure, and the notion of a “mean” is less
clearly deﬁned within such a context. We use the
kcca function found in the flexclust package in R
to perform the clustering (Leisch, 2006).

In addition, we also want to examine the data us-
ing classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) on the
Hamming distance matrix. Classical MDS, also
known as principal coordinates analysis, ﬁnds a dis-
tance matrix D(cid:48) between a set of points in some
reduced dimensional space, that is as close as pos-
sible to the original distance matrix D in the full
dimensional space. The advantage of this method
over principal components analysis (PCA) is that
it does not require a Euclidean distance measure,
which the Hamming distance is not. Of interest is
the fact that classical MDS yields the exact same re-
sults as PCA when the distance matrix is Euclidean

in R to implement classical MDS.

Finally, we consider a third unsupervised learning
algorithm: hierarchical clustering. This is an agglo-
merative method that seeks to come up with a hi-
erarchy of clusters of the haplotypes. The algo-
rithm initializes with each haplotype in its own clus-
ter. Pairs of clusters most similar to each other, as
measured by the Hamming distance, are then se-
quentially fused, until only a single cluster remains.
The distance between two clusters is taken to be
the maximum of the pairwise distances between the
haplotypes in each cluster, otherwise known as com-
plete linkage. We use the hclust function in R to
perform the clustering, and the ColorDendrogram
method found in the sparcl package to plot the
dendrogram (Witten & Tibshirani, 2010).

Results

k-medoids clustering

Using k-medoids clustering with k = 3, we found
that one Chinese, Malay, and Indian haplotype were
each respectively selected as the medoids. For the
remainder of the haplotypes, we can deﬁne a clas-
siﬁcation based on the cluster they each belong to.
For example, if a haplotype is assigned to a cluster
with a “Chinese” medoid, then it is classiﬁed as Chi-
nese. The confusion matrix arising from this process
is shown in Table 1.

As we can see from Table 1, k-medoids clustering
gives relatively good performance when attempting
to classify the three ethnic groups from this data set.
All 166 of the Indian haplotypes are correctly clas-
siﬁed, while the same is true for 99.5% and 95.5%
of the Chinese and Malay haplotypes respectively.
All misclassiﬁed Malay haplotypes are classiﬁed as
Chinese, and vice versa.

k-medoids classiﬁcation with unseen data

To see how k-medoids classiﬁcation as described in
the previous section works with previously unseen
data, we randomly split the haplotypes into training
and test sets. Overall, 134 Chinese, 125 Malay, and
116 Indian haplotypes are used for training, with
the remainder reserved for testing. Each test haplo-
type is assigned to an ethnic group according to the
medoid it is closest to. The average results over 10
trials is shown in Table 2.

As can be seen from Figure 1, three ethnic groups
constituted the majority of the migrant population
in British Singapore: the Chinese, the Malays, and
the Indians. Today, the population of Singapore
stands at 5.34 million, of which 3.87 million are res-

is as follows: 74.26% Chinese, 13.35% Malay, and
9.12% Indian (Department of Statistics, Singapore,

Yet, it likely that there exists uncharacterized sub-

it does not require a Euclidean distance measure,
which the Hamming distance is not. Of interest is
the fact that classical MDS yields the exact same re-
sults as PCA when the distance matrix is Euclidean

2

(Cox & Cox, 2001). We use the cmdscale function
in R to implement classical MDS.

Finally, we consider a third unsupervised learning
algorithm: hierarchical clustering. This is an agglo-
merative method that seeks to come up with a hi-
erarchy of clusters of the haplotypes. The algo-
rithm initializes with each haplotype in its own clus-
ter. Pairs of clusters most similar to each other, as
measured by the Hamming distance, are then se-
quentially fused, until only a single cluster remains.
The distance between two clusters is taken to be
the maximum of the pairwise distances between the
haplotypes in each cluster, otherwise known as com-
plete linkage. We use the hclust function in R to
perform the clustering, and the ColorDendrogram
method found in the sparcl package to plot the
dendrogram (Witten & Tibshirani, 2010).

Results

k-medoids clustering

Using k-medoids clustering with k = 3, we found
that one Chinese, Malay, and Indian haplotype were
each respectively selected as the medoids. For the
remainder of the haplotypes, we can deﬁne a clas-
siﬁcation based on the cluster they each belong to.
For example, if a haplotype is assigned to a cluster
with a “Chinese” medoid, then it is classiﬁed as Chi-
nese. The confusion matrix arising from this process
is shown in Table 1.

As we can see from Table 1, k-medoids clustering
gives relatively good performance when attempting
to classify the three ethnic groups from this data set.
All 166 of the Indian haplotypes are correctly clas-
siﬁed, while the same is true for 99.5% and 95.5%
of the Chinese and Malay haplotypes respectively.
All misclassiﬁed Malay haplotypes are classiﬁed as

k-medoids classiﬁcation with unseen data

To see how k-medoids classiﬁcation as described in
the previous section works with previously unseen
data, we randomly split the haplotypes into training
and test sets. Overall, 134 Chinese, 125 Malay, and
116 Indian haplotypes are used for training, with
the remainder reserved for testing. Each test haplo-
type is assigned to an ethnic group according to the
medoid it is closest to. The average results over 10
trials is shown in Table 2.

Multidimensional scaling

We make use of MDS to obtain a better visualization
of our data in lower dimensions. Figure 1 shows a
plot of the haplotypes in 2D coordinate space.

individual point is labeled according its true ethnic
group (C = Chinese, M = Malay, I = Indian), and
is colored based on the cluster it is assigned to by
the k-medoids algorithm, as per Table 1.

tering of the three diﬀerent ethnic groups in 2D coor-
dinate space. The ﬁrst (and major) coordinate sep-
arates out the Indians from the Chinese and Malays,
and the second coordinate further diﬀerentiates the
latter two groups from one another.

In addition, we can also observe, based on the how
the points are colored, where the haplotypes that
are placed into the incorrect cluster by k-medoids
lie on the MDS plot. The 8 Malay haplotypes that
are misclassiﬁed as Chinese are all on the left of
coordinate 1, placing them closer to the bulk of
the Chinese haplotypes. Similarly, the lone Chinese
haplotype wrongly labeled as Malay is proximate to
Malay haplotypes. Overall, the structure of the plot
suggests that the position of a haplotype in 2D co-
ordinate space is a strong predictor of the ethnic
group it belongs to.

Hierarchical clustering

The dendrogram arising from hierarchical clustering
is shown in Figure 2. Branches that fuse near the
bottom of the tree are more similar to each other
than branches that fuse closer to the top of the tree.
Based on the tree topography, the appropriate value
of the number of clusters, k, can then be decided
upon a posteriori.

For this particular case, the choice of k = 2, which
corresponds to taking the ﬁrst split at the very top
of the dendrogram, results in the separation of the
Indian haplotypes from the Chinese and Malay hap-
lotypes, which is the expected outcome given the re-
sults from k-medoids and MDS. However, when we
take k = 3, the second top-most split occurs within
the Indians. Therefore, hierarchical clustering ap-
pears to give an inferior performance as compared
to the previous methods we have attempted.

Nevertheless, the fact that the Indian haplotypes
have subdivisions that occur close to the top of
the tree suggests potential presence of substruc-
ture within the Singaporean Indian population. To
further investigate this claim, we repeat k-medoids
clustering with k = 4.

Introduction

Singapore is a small island-nation situated at the
tip of the Malay Peninsular in Southeast Asia. It
existed as a British colony from 1819 to 1959, in-
terspersed by a period of Japanese occupation from
1942 to 1945 during World War II. Throughout its
colonial history, Singapore has been the recipient of
extensive immigration from various parts of Asia,
and the same diversity is still reﬂected in Singa-
pore’s ethnic composition today.

Figure 1 Census data from colonial Singapore
showing the population count as broken down into
various “classes”. (Martin, 1839)

As can be seen from Figure 1, three ethnic groups
constituted the majority of the migrant population
in British Singapore: the Chinese, the Malays, and
the Indians. Today, the population of Singapore
stands at 5.34 million, of which 3.87 million are res-
idents. Of the latter group, the racial breakdown
is as follows: 74.26% Chinese, 13.35% Malay, and
9.12% Indian (Department of Statistics, Singapore,
2014), reﬂecting a multicultural landscape that is
a legacy of the country’s history over the past two
centuries.

Yet, it likely that there exists uncharacterized sub-
structure within these three ethnic populations in
Singapore. Most Singaporean Chinese originated

1

from Southern China, but belong to various dialect
groups, likely representing diﬀerent ethnic groups.
India was at that time also a British colony. Immi-
grants from India to Singapore hailed mostly from
the southern part of the country, but with a signif-
icant minority (such as the Sikhs) coming from the
north as well.
It has also been found that many
Singaporean Indians have a higher fraction of Eu-
ropean ancestry as compared to native Indian pop-
ulations. Malays are the indigenous people of the
Malay Archipelago. The native Malays of the Sin-
gapore made up just a small proportion of the to-
tal Malay population on the island, the majority of
whom migrated from Malaya (now Malaysia) and
the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).

Characterizing the population substructure of Sin-
gapore can not only help illuminate its cultural his-
tory, it also has potential medical implications for
Singaporeans. For example, uncovering population
substructure could prevent spurious results in ge-
netic association studies for disease. While many
studies have previously explored the question of sub-
structure in a global context, few have done so on a
population that exists in such close geographic prox-
imity, and therefore shares more genetic similarities.

The Singapore Genome Variation
Project

With the advent of modern-day genomic sequencing,
and the rapidly decreasing cost of the technology, it
has now become feasible to collect large amounts of
genetic data from populations that span diﬀerent ge-
ographic areas of the world. For example, the 1000
Genomes Project is an international research eﬀort
to establish the most detailed database of worldwide
human genetic variation, consisting of 697 individu-
als from 7 regions (The 1000 Genomes Project Con-
sortium, 2010). The availability of such information
has not only contributed signiﬁcantly to our under-

standing of the genetic structure that underlie the
diﬀerences between human populations, but has also
aided in the search for genetic variants that may be
associated with certain diseases or traits.

In a similar vein to the 1000 Genomes Project, the
Singapore Genome Variation Project (SGVP) aims
to provide a publicly-available resource for cata-
loging genetic variation within the Singaporean pop-
ulation, especially in the context of the three ma-
jor ethnic groups. The data can obtained online
at http://www.statgen.nus.edu.sg/~SGVP. Af-
ter some initial cleaning up, SGVP contains data
for a total 96 Chinese, 89 Malay, and 83 Indian in-
dividuals at about 1.5 million single nucleotide poly-
morphisms, or SNPs (Teo et al., 2009). SNPs, rep-
resenting a single base (A, C, G, T) change at a
single locus, is the most common way of measuring
variation within a genome.

In this project, we plan to ﬁrst apply several un-
supervised machine learning techniques on the SNP
data to see if we can reveal any underlying pop-
ulation structure. Using this information, we can
then also attempt to devise a prediction algorithm
that can classify an individual into the correct eth-
nic group based on his or her genetic data.

Methods

Data processing

The initial step of this project involves process-
ing the data into a format that is suitable for fur-
ther analysis. Since humans are diploid organisms,
SGVP has data on SNPs found on both copies of
each individual’s chromosomes. Thus, we have a to-
tal of 192 Chinese, 178 Malay, and 166 Indian hap-
lotypes. For each autosome (non-sex chromosome),
we ﬁrst identify and retain only the SNPs that can
be found in all three ethnic groups in order to en-
sure a common ground for comparison. The SNPs
are represented by 1’s and 0’s, where 1 denotes the
presence of a speciﬁc nucleotide base, and 0 denotes
the presence of an alternative base. Here, all the
SNPs are biallelic (only two possible variants exist).

We then concatenate all 22 autosomes into a sin-
gle long string consisting of a total 1,369,502 SNPs.
This is taken to be a single haplotype. Following
this, we want to compare the pairwise distances be-

tween all possible haplotype pairs by calculating a
distance matrix. The metric we choose to consider is
the Hamming distance, which is given by the num-
ber of loci at which the two haplotypes do not share
the same SNP, normalized by the total number of
SNPs. Mathematically, the Hamming distance H
between haplotypes a and b is

(cid:80)m
i=1 1{a[i] (cid:54)= b[i]}

,

Hab = Hba =

m

where in this case m = 1, 369, 502. For example,
the Hamming distance between two haplotypes that
have the same SNP at all loci is 0, whereas the Ham-
ming distance between two haplotypes that have dif-
ferent SNPs at all loci is 1.

Unsupervised learning methods

With the Hamming distance matrix calculated, we
can now proceed to apply some unsupervised learn-
ing techniques to further analyze the data. We ﬁrst
use k-medoids clustering (Kaufman & Rousseeuw,
1987) with k = 3 to see if haplotypes belonging
to the three ethnic groups can be correctly clus-
tered together. k-medoids clustering is conceptually
similar to k-means clustering, with the main diﬀer-
ence being that in the former, each cluster’s “center”
must be chosen from the original set of data points,
whereas there is no such restriction in the latter.
Here, we choose to use k-medoids instead of k-means
because the Hamming distance is a non-Euclidean
distance measure, and the notion of a “mean” is less
clearly deﬁned within such a context. We use the
kcca function found in the flexclust package in R
to perform the clustering (Leisch, 2006).

In addition, we also want to examine the data us-
ing classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) on the
Hamming distance matrix. Classical MDS, also
known as principal coordinates analysis, ﬁnds a dis-
tance matrix D(cid:48) between a set of points in some
reduced dimensional space, that is as close as pos-
sible to the original distance matrix D in the full
dimensional space. The advantage of this method
over principal components analysis (PCA) is that
it does not require a Euclidean distance measure,
which the Hamming distance is not. Of interest is
the fact that classical MDS yields the exact same re-
sults as PCA when the distance matrix is Euclidean

2

(Cox & Cox, 2001). We use the cmdscale function
in R to implement classical MDS.

Finally, we consider a third unsupervised learning
algorithm: hierarchical clustering. This is an agglo-
merative method that seeks to come up with a hi-
erarchy of clusters of the haplotypes. The algo-
rithm initializes with each haplotype in its own clus-
ter. Pairs of clusters most similar to each other, as
measured by the Hamming distance, are then se-
quentially fused, until only a single cluster remains.
The distance between two clusters is taken to be
the maximum of the pairwise distances between the
haplotypes in each cluster, otherwise known as com-
plete linkage. We use the hclust function in R to
perform the clustering, and the ColorDendrogram
method found in the sparcl package to plot the
dendrogram (Witten & Tibshirani, 2010).

Also, the exact position of an Indian haplo-
type within the yellow cluster when k = 3 is a rela-
tively good predictor of whether it gets assigned to
the yellow or green cluster when k = 4, indicating
consistency between the results from k-medoids and
MDS.

Discussion and future work

In this project, we are interested in studying how ge-
netic data can be used to identify Chinese, Malay,
and Indian Singaporeans, as well as ﬁnding out if
any additional population substructure exists be-
yond the ternary labels assigned. Previous studies
have used PCA on raw SNP data to understand pop-
ulation substructure (Patterson et. al., 2006, Price
et. al. 2008, Novembre et al. 2008). However, in
our case, we condense the information found within
the SNP data into a Hamming distance matrix. This
reduces the number of dimensions our methods have
to operate on, thereby improving runtimes.

We can see from the results of our MDS plot that co-
ordinate 1 is the principal axis of variation, and rep-
resents the separation of the Indian haplotypes from
the Chinese and Malay. This is corroborated by the
correct classiﬁcation of all Indian individuals using
k-medoids. The MDS plot also shows a smaller sep-
aration between the Chinese and Malay haplotypes
along coordinate 2. Accordingly, k-medoids exhibits
a small number of misclassiﬁcations between these
two groups. These results suggest that the three eth-
nic groups are genetically distinct enough such that
a relatively straightforward method like k-medoids
can achieve good classiﬁcation performance. Fur-
thermore, even as k-medoids clustering is an unsu-
pervised learning method, once the medoids have
been established using the training set, the test
haplotypes can be assigned to a cluster based on
their Hamming distances to the medoids, without
the need to repeat the entire algorithm.

In a previous study (Novembre et al. 2008), a PCA
plot of genetic variation within Europe corresponds
to the actual map of Europe with remarkable ac-
curacy,
indicating that the principal components
from genetic data can represent actual geographic
distances between populations. Among China, the
Malay Archipelago, and India, the latter is the most
geographically distant relative to the other two lo-
cations.
It is therefore unsurprising that our re-

sults show Indian haplotypes as being more genet-
ically distinct. Furthermore, when k-medoids is
performed with k = 4, a split within the Indian
haplotypes is observed. While we do not have the
geographic ancestry of the individuals in our data
set apart from their reported ethnic group, we hy-
pothesize that this split could correspond to Singa-
porean Indians originating from either Northern or
Southern India. The large latitudinal distance of
the country could explain why hierarchical cluster-
ing revealed substructure in the Indian haplotypes
that is not present within the Chinese and Malays.

If it were true that the observed substructure within
the Indians is due to latitude, then our MDS plot
could be revealing an east–west split along coordi-
nate 1 and a north–south split along coordinate 2.
In future work, we could explore this question by
introducing individuals known to be from Northern
and Southern India, and observe if k-medoids clus-
tering produces the expected patterns.
