A lot of work has been done on automatic genre classification for music. There are various sources of 
difficulties in this task, which have made human tagging of music tracks still far better than automated 
systems.  Much  of  the  work  on  music  classification  has  focused  on  using  supervised  learning  to 
classifying  music  into  broad  genres  like  “Hip  Hop”,  “Rock”,  “Jazz”,  and  “Classical.”  More  recent 
work  has  focused  on  automatically  tagging  songs  with  descriptive  tags  like  “cheerful”  and 
“melancholic” for automatic playlist creation and song recommendation programs [1]. 
 
One big issue with studying music files is that many of the elements that humans use to construct and 
deconstruct music, such as pitch, timbre, melody, tempo, vocal qualities, and rhythm, are not easily 
extracted from music files. Thus there has been an evolution of the features used to classify songs. One 
of the most common low-level features to use are Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) which 
are transformations of the sound frequencies in the audio files. Researchers have been successful to 
some extent in genre classification using these types of features and supervised machine learning.  
 
The aim of this project is to investigate the substructures of genres within popular music (rock, hip 
hop, pop, etc.) First music subgenres (ex. blues-rock) will be created using unsupervised learning on 
audio features that capture timbre, rhythm, and tempo. Then these subgenres or clusters will be further 
explored by examining the types of songs present in each. Finally, the relationships between subgenres 
will  be  explored.  Unlike  other  projects  in  genre  classification,  the  purpose  of  this  project  is  not  to 
classify music into human curated genres, but instead to find new genres and relationships by using 
unsupervised machine learning.

The data used for this project comes from the MusiClef 2012 Multimodal Music Data Set [1]. This is a 
collection  of  music  features  such  as  MFCCs,  Block-Level  Features,  and  PS09  features  for  1355 
popular songs by 218 artists. The dataset also includes expert curated tags for each song in the dataset. 
In order to evaluate and draw conclusions from the resulting clustering of songs, genre information 
was added to this data set for each artist from Wikipedia. For the purposes of this project, every song 
by  the  same  artist  is  associated  with  the  same  set  of  genres.  However,  expert  tags  are  associated 
directly with songs not artists.

I used three sets of features to obtain clusters from: block-level features (BLFs), PS09 features and 
MFCC features. To evaluate these clusters I used expert tags from the MusiClef dataset and genre tags 
scraped from Wikipedia.  
 
The BLFs are a set of features found to perform well when using supervised learning to classify songs 
[2]. BLFs include Spectral Pattern (SP), Delta Spectral Pattern (DSP), Variance Delta Spectral Pattern 
(VDSP),  Logarithmic  Fluctuation  Pattern  (LFP),  Correlation  Pattern  (CP)  and  Spectral  Contrast 
Pattern  (SCP).  Respectively,  these  features  reflect  the  timbre,  onsets,  strength  of  onsets,  rhythmic 
structure, harmonic relations, and “tone-ness” [2]. The authors who came up with BLFs also created a 
similarity  measure  which  can  be  calculated  between  two  songs  based  on  these  component  audio 
features.  The  weight  of  each  component  in  this  similarity  measure  was  optimized  to  best  classify  a 
music dataset using kNN. In light of this, I chose to use the pairwise similarity measures between each 
song as features.

I used three sets of features to obtain clusters from: block-level features (BLFs), PS09 features and 
MFCC features. To evaluate these clusters I used expert tags from the MusiClef dataset and genre tags 
scraped from Wikipedia.  
 
The BLFs are a set of features found to perform well when using supervised learning to classify songs 
[2]. BLFs include Spectral Pattern (SP), Delta Spectral Pattern (DSP), Variance Delta Spectral Pattern 
(VDSP),  Logarithmic  Fluctuation  Pattern  (LFP),  Correlation  Pattern  (CP)  and  Spectral  Contrast

features.  The  weight  of  each  component  in  this  similarity  measure  was  optimized  to  best  classify  a 
music dataset using kNN. In light of this, I chose to use the pairwise similarity measures between each 
song as features.

The PS09 features consist of: Fluctuation Patterns (FPs), Onset Patterns (OPs), and Onset Coefficients 
(OCs).  These  roughly  measure  patterns  of  loudness  and  tempo  [3].  The  authors  who  created  this 
feature extraction method also created a similarity measure. This measure is a combination of the three 
novel feature distances and MFCC distances between two songs. The weight of each feature distance 
in the similarity measure was chosen to optimize classification of songs using kNN. I chose to use this 
pairwise distance measure which roughly models the difference in loudness patterns, tempo and timbre 
(because of the added MFCC distance component). 
 
MFCC features were also used by finding pairwise Euclidian distances between MFCC representations 
of songs and using this distance matrix to perform k-means. In summary, I used similarity scores based 
on BLFs, PS09, and MFCC features to cluster songs. 
 
4 
 
K-means clustering was used to divide the 1355 songs into clusters of various sizes. I applied k-means 
to the BLF pairwise similarity scores and the PS09 similarity scores separately and then together. I ran 
k-means with k ranging from 5 to 100. Since the aim of this project is to understand structure within 
larger genres, I did not choose a k that was too small. Choosing a k that was too large would create 
small  clusters  of  very  similar  songs,  as  opposed  to  subgenres.  Similar  analysis  was  performed  for 
various choices of k but the presented results will be from k means run with k = 16. Clusters from the 
BLF similarity scores and PS09 scores when k = 16 provide interesting genre insights without creating 
an unwieldy number of genres. 
 
Once the songs were clustered, the clusters were examined by looking at the distribution of genres, 
artists, and tags within each cluster in conjunction with looking at the distances between clusters. 
 
5 
 
Clustering was performed over MFCC, BLF, and PS09 similarity matrices. For every combination of k 
and similarity matrix, I created a heat map to visualize the clusters (Figure 1 and 2). The heat maps are 
made  by  ordering  songs  by  assigned  cluster  along  the  x  and  y  axes,  and  then  plotting  the  pairwise 
similarity scores using colors to represent similarity. Red is used to signify songs that are similar and 
yellow  represents  songs  that  are  very  dissimilar.  I  used  these  visualizations  to  narrow  down  which 
cluster assignments to further investigate.  
 
The most promising clusterings resulted from running k-means separately on the BLF similarity matrix 
and the PS09 similarity matrix for k = 16 (Clustering BLF16 and Clustering PS16, respectively). These 
heat maps are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

After  determining  cluster  assignments  for  each  song,  I  used  expert  tags,  genre  tags,  and  artists  to 
inspect these clusters. Table 3 in the appendix shows a summary of what types of songs were found in 
each cluster. I have listed the top five most common tags, genres, and artists found in each cluster. 
Each of the clusters the BLF16 clustering and PS16 clustering is given a name that corresponds to the 
subgenre  that  cluster  represents.  This  name  was  created  by  combining  the  top  two  expert  tags 
associated with each cluster and the top two Wikipedia genres associated with each cluster. 
 
Next, I found the sum for each cluster of the squared distances between each point and its assigned 
centroid. I also determined the closest and farthest cluster (based on centroid location) for each cluster. 
All of this is summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

Discussion

Using artists, genres, and tags to examine the clusters created using k-means, we can see that the audio 
features are capturing music qualities. First, Table 3 clearly shows that this algorithm combined with 
these features are able to correctly separate artists into clusters. More importantly, the clusters clearly 
have different distributions of tags and genres. Although, Figures 1 and 2 show that the genres aren’t 
perfectly and clearly delineated, this is to be expected given that a songs musical influences are usually 
varied and numerous.  
 
Still, we can see that songs in the same cluster are more similar than songs in other clusters. We can 
also  see  certain  genres  are  extremely  dissimilar.  For  example,  in  Figure  1,  Cluster  2  “Fast-hard-
alternative-punk rock” is very different from Cluster 12 “Melancholic rock pop”, but very similar to 
Cluster 15 “Energy pop hard rock.” Similarly in Figure 2, Cluster 9 “Chaotic hard -punk-alternative

collection  of  music  features  such  as  MFCCs,  Block-Level  Features,  and  PS09  features  for  1355 
popular songs by 218 artists. The dataset also includes expert curated tags for each song in the dataset. 
In order to evaluate and draw conclusions from the resulting clustering of songs, genre information 
was added to this data set for each artist from Wikipedia. For the purposes of this project, every song 
by  the  same  artist  is  associated  with  the  same  set  of  genres.  However,  expert  tags  are  associated 
directly with songs not artists.

I used three sets of features to obtain clusters from: block-level features (BLFs), PS09 features and 
MFCC features. To evaluate these clusters I used expert tags from the MusiClef dataset and genre tags 
scraped from Wikipedia.  
 
The BLFs are a set of features found to perform well when using supervised learning to classify songs 
[2]. BLFs include Spectral Pattern (SP), Delta Spectral Pattern (DSP), Variance Delta Spectral Pattern 
(VDSP),  Logarithmic  Fluctuation  Pattern  (LFP),  Correlation  Pattern  (CP)  and  Spectral  Contrast 
Pattern  (SCP).  Respectively,  these  features  reflect  the  timbre,  onsets,  strength  of  onsets,  rhythmic 
structure, harmonic relations, and “tone-ness” [2]. The authors who came up with BLFs also created a 
similarity  measure  which  can  be  calculated  between  two  songs  based  on  these  component  audio 
features.  The  weight  of  each  component  in  this  similarity  measure  was  optimized  to  best  classify  a 
music dataset using kNN. In light of this, I chose to use the pairwise similarity measures between each 
song as features.

The PS09 features consist of: Fluctuation Patterns (FPs), Onset Patterns (OPs), and Onset Coefficients 
(OCs).  These  roughly  measure  patterns  of  loudness  and  tempo  [3].  The  authors  who  created  this 
feature extraction method also created a similarity measure. This measure is a combination of the three 
novel feature distances and MFCC distances between two songs. The weight of each feature distance 
in the similarity measure was chosen to optimize classification of songs using kNN. I chose to use this 
pairwise distance measure which roughly models the difference in loudness patterns, tempo and timbre 
(because of the added MFCC distance component). 
 
MFCC features were also used by finding pairwise Euclidian distances between MFCC representations 
of songs and using this distance matrix to perform k-means. In summary, I used similarity scores based 
on BLFs, PS09, and MFCC features to cluster songs.

K-means clustering was used to divide the 1355 songs into clusters of various sizes. I applied k-means 
to the BLF pairwise similarity scores and the PS09 similarity scores separately and then together. I ran 
k-means with k ranging from 5 to 100. Since the aim of this project is to understand structure within 
larger genres, I did not choose a k that was too small. Choosing a k that was too large would create 
small  clusters  of  very  similar  songs,  as  opposed  to  subgenres.  Similar  analysis  was  performed  for 
various choices of k but the presented results will be from k means run with k = 16. Clusters from the 
BLF similarity scores and PS09 scores when k = 16 provide interesting genre insights without creating 
an unwieldy number of genres. 
 
Once the songs were clustered, the clusters were examined by looking at the distribution of genres, 
artists, and tags within each cluster in conjunction with looking at the distances between clusters.

Clustering was performed over MFCC, BLF, and PS09 similarity matrices. For every combination of k 
and similarity matrix, I created a heat map to visualize the clusters (Figure 1 and 2). The heat maps are 
made  by  ordering  songs  by  assigned  cluster  along  the  x  and  y  axes,  and  then  plotting  the  pairwise 
similarity scores using colors to represent similarity. Red is used to signify songs that are similar and 
yellow  represents  songs  that  are  very  dissimilar.  I  used  these  visualizations  to  narrow  down  which 
cluster assignments to further investigate.  
 
The most promising clusterings resulted from running k-means separately on the BLF similarity matrix 
and the PS09 similarity matrix for k = 16 (Clustering BLF16 and Clustering PS16, respectively). These 
heat maps are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

After  determining  cluster  assignments  for  each  song,  I  used  expert  tags,  genre  tags,  and  artists  to 
inspect these clusters. Table 3 in the appendix shows a summary of what types of songs were found in 
each cluster. I have listed the top five most common tags, genres, and artists found in each cluster. 
Each of the clusters the BLF16 clustering and PS16 clustering is given a name that corresponds to the 
subgenre  that  cluster  represents.  This  name  was  created  by  combining  the  top  two  expert  tags 
associated with each cluster and the top two Wikipedia genres associated with each cluster. 
 
Next, I found the sum for each cluster of the squared distances between each point and its assigned 
centroid. I also determined the closest and farthest cluster (based on centroid location) for each cluster. 
All of this is summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

Discussion

Using artists, genres, and tags to examine the clusters created using k-means, we can see that the audio 
features are capturing music qualities. First, Table 3 clearly shows that this algorithm combined with 
these features are able to correctly separate artists into clusters. More importantly, the clusters clearly 
have different distributions of tags and genres. Although, Figures 1 and 2 show that the genres aren’t 
perfectly and clearly delineated, this is to be expected given that a songs musical influences are usually 
varied and numerous.  
 
Still, we can see that songs in the same cluster are more similar than songs in other clusters. We can 
also  see  certain  genres  are  extremely  dissimilar.  For  example,  in  Figure  1,  Cluster  2  “Fast-hard-
alternative-punk rock” is very different from Cluster 12 “Melancholic rock pop”, but very similar to 
Cluster 15 “Energy pop hard rock.” Similarly in Figure 2, Cluster 9 “Chaotic hard -punk-alternative

rock” is very different from Cluster 7 “Beat repetitive hip hop rhythm and blues” and Cluster 8 “Soft 
romantic pop rhythm and blues”.  
 
From table 2, we see that Cluster 13 “Soft romantic rhythm and blues soul” and Cluster 9 “Chaotic 
hard -punk-alternative rock” are the most prevalent clusters in the “Farthest Cluster” column. From 
this, we can conclude that perhaps these clusters are very different from many other musical genres.  
 
Graphs 1 through 4 give further insight into the qualities of music in different genres. For example, 
Graph 1 shows that virtually every cluster has many songs associated with the “Rhythm and Blues” 
genre, which is to be expected given the profound influence of rhythm and blues on modern popular 
music.  However,  Graph  2  shows  that  “Heavy  Metal”  songs  are  overwhelmingly  found  in  Cluster  2 
because  Heavy  Metal  has  very  distinct  characteristics.  Similarly,  songs  tagged  as  “catchy”  can  be 
found  in  every  single  cluster,  but  songs  tagged  as  “aggressive”  are  also  overwhelmingly  found  in 
Cluster 2. Thus, this type of analysis helps identify what genres are influential in many types of music 
versus specialized genres. We can also learn what types of tags are indicative of certain subgenres and 
what descriptions are vague and easily applicable to many genres.

of songs classified as “aggressive” per cluster in BLF16.

One future direction of interest is to explore the evolution of genres throughout the 20th century. To do 
this, first I would like to augment this data set with more features and more songs. Specifically, I 
would like to add data about the year a song was written, the year a song was recorded, the artist’s 
place of origin, and genre information by song as opposed to artist. In addition, an ideal data set would 
have all of these features with more songs for each year. 
 
Given this augmented data set, similar analysis could be done to find relationships between artist 
birthplace and song year and subgenre. Further, I would like to create clusters similar to those created 
in this project but within time periods. Then, I would examine the closest clusters between time periods 
in order to model the evolution of genres and subgenres. This could also give insight into how past 
genres are combined to create new genres with multiple influences. 
 
The question of discovering hidden relationships between music genres across time is not only a topic 
of interest, but it also has potential commercial applications. This exploration could potentially lead to 
using machine learning to determine artist influences, which is directly applicable to playlist creation 
and song recommendation.

Understanding Music Genre Similarity 

Gabriela Groth 

Stanford University

Introduction 

1 
 
A lot of work has been done on automatic genre classification for music. There are various sources of 
difficulties in this task, which have made human tagging of music tracks still far better than automated 
systems.  Much  of  the  work  on  music  classification  has  focused  on  using  supervised  learning  to 
classifying  music  into  broad  genres  like  “Hip  Hop”,  “Rock”,  “Jazz”,  and  “Classical.”  More  recent 
work  has  focused  on  automatically  tagging  songs  with  descriptive  tags  like  “cheerful”  and 
“melancholic” for automatic playlist creation and song recommendation programs [1]. 
 
One big issue with studying music files is that many of the elements that humans use to construct and 
deconstruct music, such as pitch, timbre, melody, tempo, vocal qualities, and rhythm, are not easily 
extracted from music files. Thus there has been an evolution of the features used to classify songs. One 
of the most common low-level features to use are Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) which 
are transformations of the sound frequencies in the audio files. Researchers have been successful to 
some extent in genre classification using these types of features and supervised machine learning.  
 
The aim of this project is to investigate the substructures of genres within popular music (rock, hip 
hop, pop, etc.) First music subgenres (ex. blues-rock) will be created using unsupervised learning on 
audio features that capture timbre, rhythm, and tempo. Then these subgenres or clusters will be further 
explored by examining the types of songs present in each. Finally, the relationships between subgenres 
will  be  explored.  Unlike  other  projects  in  genre  classification,  the  purpose  of  this  project  is  not  to 
classify music into human curated genres, but instead to find new genres and relationships by using 
unsupervised machine learning.

The data used for this project comes from the MusiClef 2012 Multimodal Music Data Set [1]. This is a 
collection  of  music  features  such  as  MFCCs,  Block-Level  Features,  and  PS09  features  for  1355 
popular songs by 218 artists. The dataset also includes expert curated tags for each song in the dataset. 
In order to evaluate and draw conclusions from the resulting clustering of songs, genre information 
was added to this data set for each artist from Wikipedia. For the purposes of this project, every song 
by  the  same  artist  is  associated  with  the  same  set  of  genres.  However,  expert  tags  are  associated 
directly with songs not artists.

I used three sets of features to obtain clusters from: block-level features (BLFs), PS09 features and 
MFCC features. To evaluate these clusters I used expert tags from the MusiClef dataset and genre tags 
scraped from Wikipedia.  
 
The BLFs are a set of features found to perform well when using supervised learning to classify songs 
[2]. BLFs include Spectral Pattern (SP), Delta Spectral Pattern (DSP), Variance Delta Spectral Pattern 
(VDSP),  Logarithmic  Fluctuation  Pattern  (LFP),  Correlation  Pattern  (CP)  and  Spectral  Contrast 
Pattern  (SCP).  Respectively,  these  features  reflect  the  timbre,  onsets,  strength  of  onsets,  rhythmic 
structure, harmonic relations, and “tone-ness” [2]. The authors who came up with BLFs also created a 
similarity  measure  which  can  be  calculated  between  two  songs  based  on  these  component  audio 
features.  The  weight  of  each  component  in  this  similarity  measure  was  optimized  to  best  classify  a 
music dataset using kNN. In light of this, I chose to use the pairwise similarity measures between each 
song as features.

The PS09 features consist of: Fluctuation Patterns (FPs), Onset Patterns (OPs), and Onset Coefficients

on BLFs, PS09, and MFCC features to cluster songs.

Discussion

Using artists, genres, and tags to examine the clusters created using k-means, we can see that the audio 
features are capturing music qualities. First, Table 3 clearly shows that this algorithm combined with 
these features are able to correctly separate artists into clusters. More importantly, the clusters clearly 
have different distributions of tags and genres. Although, Figures 1 and 2 show that the genres aren’t 
perfectly and clearly delineated, this is to be expected given that a songs musical influences are usually 
varied and numerous.  
 
Still, we can see that songs in the same cluster are more similar than songs in other clusters. We can 
also  see  certain  genres  are  extremely  dissimilar.  For  example,  in  Figure  1,  Cluster  2  “Fast-hard-
alternative-punk rock” is very different from Cluster 12 “Melancholic rock pop”, but very similar to 
Cluster 15 “Energy pop hard rock.” Similarly in Figure 2, Cluster 9 “Chaotic hard -punk-alternative

rock” is very different from Cluster 7 “Beat repetitive hip hop rhythm and blues” and Cluster 8 “Soft 
romantic pop rhythm and blues”.  
 
From table 2, we see that Cluster 13 “Soft romantic rhythm and blues soul” and Cluster 9 “Chaotic 
hard -punk-alternative rock” are the most prevalent clusters in the “Farthest Cluster” column. From 
this, we can conclude that perhaps these clusters are very different from many other musical genres.  
 
Graphs 1 through 4 give further insight into the qualities of music in different genres. For example, 
Graph 1 shows that virtually every cluster has many songs associated with the “Rhythm and Blues” 
genre, which is to be expected given the profound influence of rhythm and blues on modern popular 
music.  However,  Graph  2  shows  that  “Heavy  Metal”  songs  are  overwhelmingly  found  in  Cluster  2 
because  Heavy  Metal  has  very  distinct  characteristics.  Similarly,  songs  tagged  as  “catchy”  can  be 
found  in  every  single  cluster,  but  songs  tagged  as  “aggressive”  are  also  overwhelmingly  found  in 
Cluster 2. Thus, this type of analysis helps identify what genres are influential in many types of music 
versus specialized genres. We can also learn what types of tags are indicative of certain subgenres and 
what descriptions are vague and easily applicable to many genres. 
 
Graphs  1-4.  1)  Number  of  songs  in  “Rhythm  and  Blues”  genre  per  cluster  in  BLF16.  2)  Number  of  songs 
classified as “Heavy Metal” per cluster BLF16. 3) Number of songs tagged with “catchy” in BLF16. 4) Number 
of songs classified as “aggressive” per cluster in BLF16.

One future direction of interest is to explore the evolution of genres throughout the 20th century. To do 
this, first I would like to augment this data set with more features and more songs. Specifically, I 
would like to add data about the year a song was written, the year a song was recorded, the artist’s 
place of origin, and genre information by song as opposed to artist. In addition, an ideal data set would 
have all of these features with more songs for each year. 
 
Given this augmented data set, similar analysis could be done to find relationships between artist 
birthplace and song year and subgenre. Further, I would like to create clusters similar to those created 
in this project but within time periods. Then, I would examine the closest clusters between time periods 
in order to model the evolution of genres and subgenres. This could also give insight into how past 
genres are combined to create new genres with multiple influences. 
 
The question of discovering hidden relationships between music genres across time is not only a topic 
of interest, but it also has potential commercial applications. This exploration could potentially lead to 
using machine learning to determine artist influences, which is directly applicable to playlist creation 
and song recommendation.
