Abstract 

Current  3D  audio  technology  used  for  virtual  and  augmented  reality  systems 
lack the immersive qualities of real acoustic spaces. This limitation is rooted in 
an  inability  to  easily  measure  individualized  head-related  transfer  functions 
(HRTFs) in a commercial setting. This study shows how the iterative construct 
of a joint-maximization EM algorithm can be applied to derive a novel method 
for cheap, “portable” HRTF estimation that eliminates both head-tracking and/or 
prior source location knowledge from the process.

realistic  virtual  spatial  origin  and  immersive  realism.  Accordingly,  if  the  HRTF  is  non-individualized  or  poorly

An EM-Derived Approach to Blind HRTF Estimation

Abstract 

Current  3D  audio  technology  used  for  virtual  and  augmented  reality  systems 
lack the immersive qualities of real acoustic spaces. This limitation is rooted in 
an  inability  to  easily  measure  individualized  head-related  transfer  functions 
(HRTFs) in a commercial setting. This study shows how the iterative construct 
of a joint-maximization EM algorithm can be applied to derive a novel method 
for cheap, “portable” HRTF estimation that eliminates both head-tracking and/or 
prior source location knowledge from the process.  

Introduction  

 
 
1 
 
In  natural  listening  environments,  humans  use  a  unique  set  of  acoustic  cues  to  localize  incoming  sounds.  These 
localization  cues,  collectively  represented  by  a  head  related  transfer  function  (HRTF),  describe  the  acoustic 
transformations caused by interactions of a sound wave with a listener’s head, shoulders, and outer ears. In virtual 
audio applications, an individually measured HRTF is essential because it is used to give headphone-based sounds a 
realistic  virtual  spatial  origin  and  immersive  realism.  Accordingly,  if  the  HRTF  is  non-individualized  or  poorly 
estimated,  it  has  the  tendency  to  cause  unwanted  distortions  and  undesirable  artifacts  in  the  sound’s  perceived 
location when presented over headphones [1]. 
 
Traditionally, HRTFs are measured acoustically, based on binaural (“two-ear”) recordings of a known test stimuli 
that are played from loudspeakers in 3D space. In general, the HRTF is a 2D continuous function defined over the 
unit sphere in 3D space, and a measurement for a given loudspeaker location represents a sample HRTF. It thus 
follows that a full representation of an HRTF obtained via conventional discrete acoustic measurements, requires an 
effective interpolation of collected sample HRTFs throughout all of space. Fortunately, with the development of a 
spherical  harmonic  (SH)  based  HRTF  interpolation  technique  [2],  a  continuous  individualized  HRTF  can  be 
estimated using  many spatially distributed samples. 
 
While intepolation of a continuous HRTF is possible from discrete HRTF measurements, it requires knowledge of 
each  sample  HRTF’s  location.  In  typical  laboratory  setups,  this  information  is  provided  by  knowing  a-priori  a 
loudspeaker’s location relative to a listener’s fixed head position, or tracking a listener’s moving head while keeping 
the loudspeakers fixed. Unfortunately, even though simple head tracking technology has recently become more cost 
effective, it still presents a significant financial investment for the average potential consumer of virtual audio.  
 
A  potential  solution  to  this  problem  would  be  to  try  to  estimate  a  continuous  HRTF  without  head-tracking  or 
loudspeaker  arrays.  Consider  a  sample  HRTF  collected  without  knowledge  of  the  spatial  origin  of  the  recorded 
stimulus. This observation has some interesting consequences for HRTF estimation in context of machine learning 
paradigms  because  viewing  this  location  as  a  latent  variable  converts  HRTF  estimation  into  an  unsupervised 
learning  problem.  Here,  the  goal  of  estimating  an  HRTF  could  be  approached  as  a  two-step  iterative  machine 
learning algorithm: (1) binaural source localization based on knowledge of the underlying continuous HRTF and test 
stimulus,  and  (2)  continuous  HRTF  interpolation  from  knowledge  of  several  sample  HRTFs  and  their  locations.  
Figure 1 below illustrates the “chicken-versus-egg” nature of this two-step estimation problem. 

 

 

Figure 1: “Chicken-versus-egg” problem for HRTF estimation  

refers to the fact that these binaural recordings were collected in a quiet anechoic chamber. As a pre-processing step 

This study presents a novel method for HRTF estimation derived from Expectation-Maximization (EM) theory, by 
collecting sample HRTF measurements on individuals varying their head rotation angle relative to a single fixed 
speaker  without  explicit  knowledge  of  the  source  location.  The  goal  is  to  achieve  an  accurate  estimate  of  an 
individual’s HRTF by eliminating any sort of head-tracking or prior source location knowledge from the process.

Datasets of binaural recordings containing approximately 277 non-redundant measurements (evenly distributed over 
3D  space)  were  used  in  place  of  real-time  measurements  for  the  purpose  of  developing  and  refining  the  EM 
algorithm.  Twelve  separate  datasets  were  collected  in  all,  representing  sets  of  binaural  recordings  collected  for

Θ= 𝜃(!),…,𝜃(!) !
  for 𝒳  existed,  finding  the  continuous  HRTF  parameters  𝑐,  would  become  the  standard 
continuous HRTF interpolation procedure. Likewise, having complete prior knowledge of the continuous HRTF,  𝑐, 
and 𝒳  would  trivialize  the  labeling  of  each  recording,  becoming  binaural  source  localization.  The  proposed 
technique is an attempt at estimating the continuous HRTF,𝑐, having a dataset 𝒳, but no knowledge of Θ, hence the 
algorithm becomes a joint maximization procedure that iteratively maximizes a function, ℱ𝑄,𝑐 , where 𝑐 is the  
parameter described above, and 𝑄!(𝜃!) is an arbitrary distribution over the unobserved variables, given the support 
𝑄!(𝜃!)=  𝑝𝜃! 𝑥(!);𝑐 . The iterative procedure is carried out in two alternating maximization steps on function, 
ℱ𝑄,𝑐 , and proceeds as follows, repeating until convergence: 
For each 𝑖, set 𝑄!!  to the 𝑄! that maximizes ℱ𝑄!,𝑐(!!!)  
where 𝑐(!!!) is either the initial  𝑐!, or the updated 𝑐!  from previous iteration of M-Step 2. 

HRTFs collected are “blind” to location. 
 
For this application, it is useful to begin the formulation of an EM as a coordinate ascent process. With this, the

In this study, a broader view of the traditional EM algorithm is adopted, in which focus is placed on the strategy and 

choice makes the formulation of the algorithm more amenable to the existing body of work on HRTF interpolation 
and  binaural  source  localization,  as  practical  constructs  established  from  within  existing  research  can  be  used  to 
approximate each M-Step. This is the topic of the proceeding section.

This study used the iterative construct of a joint-maximization EM algorithm to derive a novel method for HRTF 
estimation that eliminates both head-tracking and/or prior positional source location knowledge from the process.  
Keeping to the practical problem, assumptions were made which generalized each M-Step into a more modular form 
and did in fact eliminate some of the rigor built into the strict EM formulation; however, the overall method was 
successful  in  its  estimation  of  a  continuous  HRTF  across  a  database  of  twelve  subjects,  as  both  the  simulated 
average angular error on testing data and the spectral distortion improved over the course of iteration. To ensure 
robustness for measurements taken in everyday listening environments (the eventual objective), the necessary next 
steps involve consideration of non-anechoic and noisy recordings to see how the proposed method handles more 
realistic  input  data.  Furthermore,  note  that  currently,  the  testing  locations  are  evenly  distributed  over  3D  space. 
Randomizing or perhaps developing realistic paths (representing the motions of a person using the technique) would 
present  an  interesting  follow  up  study,  as  well.  Finally,  it  is  essential  to  begin  formulating  a  plan  for  perceptual 
testing  of  the  estimated  continuous  HRTF  structures,  to  ensure  that  the  metrics  defined  function  as  suitable 
maximum likelihood estimators.
