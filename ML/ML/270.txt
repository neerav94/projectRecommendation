Soil contamination is characterized by solid or liq-

coming  into  contact  with  contaminated  soil.  Due 
to the detrimental nature of contamination and the 
multiple methods to address soil pollution, it is of 
key interest to be able to determine whether spe-
cific sites have contaminated soil.  
Soil  contaminants  may  vary  in  both  location  and

By determining the order of importance in the fea-
tures,  it  would  be  possible  to  establish  key  fea-
tures  that  influence  the  contamination  classifica-
tion  of  a  given  soil  sample.  From  a  different  per-
spective,  it  opens  the  possibility  that  certain  fea-
tures are not necessary. Removing non-important 
features  greatly  simplifies  computation  for  future 
analyses. 
4.2 K-Fold Cross Validation 
Samples were randomly grouped into 19 subsets 
of 23 samples. This method allows for contamina-
tion  predictions  on  the  given  dataset  without  re-
quiring additional samples from the field. The ran-
domness  also  provides  variation  in  the  training 
sets  for  the  subsequent  Gaussian  discriminant 
analysis. 
An extreme version of K-fold cross validation was 
also  explored:  the  jackknife  resampling  method. 
Using this method, an algorithm is trained on the 
entire dataset, save for a single sample. The algo-
rithm is subsequently tested on the sample to de-
termine effectiveness of training. 
4.3 Gaussian Discriminant Analysis 
Using  the  assignments  from  K-means  clustering, 
linear discriminant analysis was used to generate a 
predictor for potential future samples to be taken 
from the site. The performance for linear discrimi-
nant analysis (LDA) was compared to the perfor-
mance for quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA).  
For a given cross validation set, predictions were 
made  both  using  the  assumption  that  the  vari-
ances  between  “naturally”  and  “unnaturally”  con-
taminated samples are equal. The accuracy of the 
resulting indication is then compared to the accu-
racy  of  the  prediction  made  without  assuming 
equal variance.  
 
5. Results and Analysis 
5.1 K-means Clustering 
Usage  of  K-means  clustering  to  identify  two  dis-
tinct clusters always produced the same number 
of  “naturally”  and  “unnaturally”  contaminated 
samples  (i.e.  267  “naturally”  contaminated  sam-
ples  and  170  “unnaturally”  contaminated  sam-

 

 

3 

Natural 

Unnatural 

ples). Furthermore, the centroids were consistently 
generated.  This  regularity  in  results  strongly  sug-
gests the existence of two classes of contamina-
tion samples. 
However, when using K-means clustering to iden-
tify  three  or  four  distinct  clusters,  the  resulting 
classifications  were  not  unique.  Specifically,  K-
means clustering was not able to converge to the 
same set of clusters given random centroid initiali-
zation.  It  is  unlikely  that  more  than  two  types  of 
contamination exist within the given dataset; there 
is a strong implication that there is a single source 
of contamination on the site. Given the lack of uni-
formity in classification assignments, gaussian dis-
criminant  analysis  was  not  reasonable  and  was 
not further explored for more than two classifica-
tions.

ABSTRACT: Soil pollution is can be considered to 
be an imbalance of chemicals in the soil at a particu-
lar  site.  Such  unnatural  contamination  must  be  ad-
dressed to avoid hazard to the environment and in-
habitants of a polluted site. However, it is important 
to first be able to identify whether a site is contami-
nated before determining a solution. This paper ex-
plores the classification of soil samples at a particular 
site  (McConnell  Air  Force  Base)  to  investigate  the 
natural or unnatural contamination of soil. The sam-
ples are addressed using k-means clustering, k-fold 
cross validation, and Gaussian discriminant analysis. 
From these evaluations, contamination at the site of 
interest can be considered. 

1. Introduction 
Soil contamination is characterized by solid or liq-
uid  hazardous  substances  mixed  with  naturally 
occurring soil. Soil pollution can arise from a num-
ber  of  sources,  which  could  be  both  naturally-
occurring  in  soil  and  man-made.  In  other  words, 
the  ratio  of  chemicals  in  the  soil  of  a  given  site 
may  be  attributed  to  both  natural  and  unnatural 
accumulation or production of compounds due to 
specific environmental conditions. These contami-
nants  can  adversely  impact  the  health  of  plants, 
animals,  and  humans  when  directly  or  indirectly 
coming  into  contact  with  contaminated  soil.  Due 
to the detrimental nature of contamination and the 
multiple methods to address soil pollution, it is of 
key interest to be able to determine whether spe-
cific sites have contaminated soil.  
Soil  contaminants  may  vary  in  both  location  and 
type. In this report, the scope of the soil contami-
nation  is  limited  to  soil  samples  taken  from  the 
McConnell  Air  Force  Base.  The  components  in-
vestigated  in  the  soil  samples  are  fixed  as  non-

biological concentrations. The goal to be accom-
plished is to be able to discern between naturally-
contaminated  soil  samples  and  unnaturally-
contaminated soil samples. If the samples can be 
consistently classified, a geographical mapping of 
the unnatural (i.e. man-made) contamination loca-
tions  may  help  to  determine  the  source(s)  of  con-
tamination. 
 
2. Data Set 
The  samples  taken  from  McConnell  Air  Force 
Base  were  tasted  in  a  laboratory  for  concentra-
tions of eighteen metals: Aluminum, Arsenic, Bari-
um,  Beryllium,  Calcium,  Total  Chromium,  Cobalt, 
Copper, 
Iron,  Lead,  Magnesium,  Manganese, 
Mercury,  Nickel,  Potassium,  Sodium,  Vanadium, 
and Zinc. The 437 samples were also mapped to 
geographic locations around the site, allowing for 
postliminary contamination assignments.  
 
3. Features and Preprocessing 
Due  the  wide  range  of  various  concentrations  in 
the dataset, the log-distributions of the concentra-
tions  were  analyzed  to  scale  and  compare  soil 
components.  The  features  were  assumed  to  be 
Gaussian. The log-normal distributions are provid-
ed in Figure 1.  
For subsequent analysis, the means and standard 
deviations of the metal components are present in 
Figure 2. Furthermore, the geographic locations of 
each soil sample on the site have been provided in 
Figure 3.

4. Models and Strategies 
To  analyze  the  samples,  three  approaches  were 
investigated: K-means clustering, K-fold cross val-
idation, and Gaussian discriminant analysis. 
4.1 K-means Clustering 
The dataset was first grouped assuming that there

These  two  clusters  would  represent  “naturally

sequently grouped with the assumption that three 
or  more  clusters  were  present.  These  cluster-
centroids  would  also  represent  different  types  of 
contamination and potentially different sources of 
contamination. 
The features were investigated to determine a hi-
erarchy of significance. The importance of a metal 
with  respect  to  its  impact  on  classification  was 
evaluated by comparing the standard deviation of 
the  lognormal  concentration  spread  to  the  “dis-
tance” between the centroids at that feature. The 
closer the concentrations at the centroids, the less 
“important” it was deemed to be.

By determining the order of importance in the fea-
tures,  it  would  be  possible  to  establish  key  fea-
tures  that  influence  the  contamination  classifica-
tion  of  a  given  soil  sample.  From  a  different  per-
spective,  it  opens  the  possibility  that  certain  fea-
tures are not necessary. Removing non-important 
features  greatly  simplifies  computation  for  future 
analyses. 
4.2 K-Fold Cross Validation 
Samples were randomly grouped into 19 subsets 
of 23 samples. This method allows for contamina-
tion  predictions  on  the  given  dataset  without  re-
quiring additional samples from the field. The ran-
domness  also  provides  variation  in  the  training 
sets  for  the  subsequent  Gaussian  discriminant 
analysis. 
An extreme version of K-fold cross validation was 
also  explored:  the  jackknife  resampling  method. 
Using this method, an algorithm is trained on the 
entire dataset, save for a single sample. The algo-
rithm is subsequently tested on the sample to de-
termine effectiveness of training. 
4.3 Gaussian Discriminant Analysis 
Using  the  assignments  from  K-means  clustering, 
linear discriminant analysis was used to generate a 
predictor for potential future samples to be taken 
from the site. The performance for linear discrimi-
nant analysis (LDA) was compared to the perfor-
mance for quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA).  
For a given cross validation set, predictions were 
made  both  using  the  assumption  that  the  vari-
ances  between  “naturally”  and  “unnaturally”  con-
taminated samples are equal. The accuracy of the 
resulting indication is then compared to the accu-
racy  of  the  prediction  made  without  assuming 
equal variance.  
 
5. Results and Analysis 
5.1 K-means Clustering 
Usage  of  K-means  clustering  to  identify  two  dis-
tinct clusters always produced the same number 
of  “naturally”  and  “unnaturally”  contaminated 
samples  (i.e.  267  “naturally”  contaminated  sam-
ples  and  170  “unnaturally”  contaminated  sam-

Natural 

Unnatural 

ples). Furthermore, the centroids were consistently 
generated.  This  regularity  in  results  strongly  sug-
gests the existence of two classes of contamina-
tion samples. 
However, when using K-means clustering to iden-
tify  three  or  four  distinct  clusters,  the  resulting 
classifications  were  not  unique.  Specifically,  K-
means clustering was not able to converge to the 
same set of clusters given random centroid initiali-
zation.  It  is  unlikely  that  more  than  two  types  of 
contamination exist within the given dataset; there 
is a strong implication that there is a single source 
of contamination on the site. Given the lack of uni-
formity in classification assignments, gaussian dis-
criminant  analysis  was  not  reasonable  and  was 
not further explored for more than two classifica-
tions.

Figure 5: Hierarchy of Significance 
From this data, it is apparent that the unnaturally 
contaminated soil samples have significantly high-
er concentrations of metals such as Barium, Mer-
cury, and Lead. 
To explore the impact of the features on the clas-
sifications, K-means clustering was performed on 
the samples with reduced features. Features were 
removed  in  order  of  increasing  importance  until 
the  “most  significant”  feature  was  left  to  classify 
the  dataset.  In  each  case,  the  same  centroids 
were repeatedly generated.

The trend seems to imply that the addition of cer-
tain features do not significantly aid in the classifi-
cation process of the dataset (i.e. where the lines 
are  relatively  flat).  However,  running  K-means  on 
the set without those features does not provide an 
accurate representation of the classifications.

It is interesting to note that, for this particular da-
taset,  the  jackknife  resampling  method  boosted 
the accuracy of linear discriminant analysis predic-
tions  and  decreased  the  accuracy  of  quadratic 
discriminant  analysis  predictions.  Furthermore, 
usage of the jackknife resampling method did not 
appear  to  influence  positive  or  negative  predic-
tions of naturally contaminated soil samples; it only 
affected  predictions  of  unnaturally  contaminated 
soil samples. 
Although  the  jackknife  resampling  method  pro-
vides small improvements to the linear and quad-
ratic discriminant analyses, generating the predic-
tions  also  took  considerably  longer.  For  signifi-
cantly  larger  datasets,  the  tradeoff  may  be  less 
favorable. Likewise, for smaller datasets, the jack-
knife  resampling  method  could  be  a  worthwhile 
investment. 
Regardless  of  the  sampling  for  training  and  test-
ing,  quadratic  discriminant  analysis  consistently 
performed better than linear discriminant analysis. 
This outcome is expected because the quadratic 
discriminant  analysis  operates  on  fewer  assump-
tions (i.e. shared variance) than linear discriminant 
analysis. 
 

Classification of Soil Contamination 

Aleo Mok

CS229 Final Project Report 

 

 

ABSTRACT: Soil pollution is can be considered to 
be an imbalance of chemicals in the soil at a particu-
lar  site.  Such  unnatural  contamination  must  be  ad-
dressed to avoid hazard to the environment and in-
habitants of a polluted site. However, it is important 
to first be able to identify whether a site is contami-
nated before determining a solution. This paper ex-
plores the classification of soil samples at a particular 
site  (McConnell  Air  Force  Base)  to  investigate  the 
natural or unnatural contamination of soil. The sam-
ples are addressed using k-means clustering, k-fold 
cross validation, and Gaussian discriminant analysis. 
From these evaluations, contamination at the site of 
interest can be considered. 

1. Introduction 
Soil contamination is characterized by solid or liq-
uid  hazardous  substances  mixed  with  naturally 
occurring soil. Soil pollution can arise from a num-
ber  of  sources,  which  could  be  both  naturally-
occurring  in  soil  and  man-made.  In  other  words, 
the  ratio  of  chemicals  in  the  soil  of  a  given  site 
may  be  attributed  to  both  natural  and  unnatural 
accumulation or production of compounds due to 
specific environmental conditions. These contami-
nants  can  adversely  impact  the  health  of  plants, 
animals,  and  humans  when  directly  or  indirectly 
coming  into  contact  with  contaminated  soil.  Due 
to the detrimental nature of contamination and the 
multiple methods to address soil pollution, it is of 
key interest to be able to determine whether spe-
cific sites have contaminated soil.  
Soil  contaminants  may  vary  in  both  location  and 
type. In this report, the scope of the soil contami-
nation  is  limited  to  soil  samples  taken  from  the 
McConnell  Air  Force  Base.  The  components  in-
vestigated  in  the  soil  samples  are  fixed  as  non-

 

1 

biological concentrations. The goal to be accom-
plished is to be able to discern between naturally-
contaminated  soil  samples  and  unnaturally-
contaminated soil samples. If the samples can be 
consistently classified, a geographical mapping of 
the unnatural (i.e. man-made) contamination loca-
tions  may  help  to  determine  the  source(s)  of  con-
tamination. 
 
2. Data Set 
The  samples  taken  from  McConnell  Air  Force 
Base  were  tasted  in  a  laboratory  for  concentra-
tions of eighteen metals: Aluminum, Arsenic, Bari-
um,  Beryllium,  Calcium,  Total  Chromium,  Cobalt, 
Copper, 
Iron,  Lead,  Magnesium,  Manganese, 
Mercury,  Nickel,  Potassium,  Sodium,  Vanadium, 
and Zinc. The 437 samples were also mapped to 
geographic locations around the site, allowing for 
postliminary contamination assignments.  
 
3. Features and Preprocessing 
Due  the  wide  range  of  various  concentrations  in 
the dataset, the log-distributions of the concentra-
tions  were  analyzed  to  scale  and  compare  soil 
components.  The  features  were  assumed  to  be 
Gaussian. The log-normal distributions are provid-
ed in Figure 1.  
For subsequent analysis, the means and standard 
deviations of the metal components are present in 
Figure 2. Furthermore, the geographic locations of 
each soil sample on the site have been provided in 
Figure 3. 
 
 

 

Figure 3: Geographical Mapping of Soil Samples 
 
4. Models and Strategies 
To  analyze  the  samples,  three  approaches  were 
investigated: K-means clustering, K-fold cross val-
idation, and Gaussian discriminant analysis. 
4.1 K-means Clustering 
The dataset was first grouped assuming that there 
were  two  clusters  and  analyzed  for  consistency. 
These  two  clusters  would  represent  “naturally 
contaminated” soil samples and “unnaturally con-
taminated” soil samples. The datasets were sub-
sequently grouped with the assumption that three 
or  more  clusters  were  present.  These  cluster-
centroids  would  also  represent  different  types  of 
contamination and potentially different sources of 
contamination. 
The features were investigated to determine a hi-
erarchy of significance. The importance of a metal 
with  respect  to  its  impact  on  classification  was 
evaluated by comparing the standard deviation of 
the  lognormal  concentration  spread  to  the  “dis-
tance” between the centroids at that feature. The 
closer the concentrations at the centroids, the less 
“important” it was deemed to be.

By determining the order of importance in the fea-
tures,  it  would  be  possible  to  establish  key  fea-
tures  that  influence  the  contamination  classifica-
tion  of  a  given  soil  sample.  From  a  different  per-
spective,  it  opens  the  possibility  that  certain  fea-

features  greatly  simplifies  computation  for  future 
analyses. 
4.2 K-Fold Cross Validation 
Samples were randomly grouped into 19 subsets 
of 23 samples. This method allows for contamina-
tion  predictions  on  the  given  dataset  without  re-

domness  also  provides  variation  in  the  training

rithm is subsequently tested on the sample to de-
termine effectiveness of training. 
4.3 Gaussian Discriminant Analysis 
Using  the  assignments  from  K-means  clustering, 
linear discriminant analysis was used to generate a 
predictor for potential future samples to be taken 
from the site. The performance for linear discrimi-
nant analysis (LDA) was compared to the perfor-
mance for quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA).  
For a given cross validation set, predictions were 
made  both  using  the  assumption  that  the  vari-

the accuracy of linear discriminant analysis predic-
tions  and  decreased  the  accuracy  of  quadratic 
discriminant  analysis  predictions.  Furthermore,

5.3 Geographical Plot of Contamination 
After establishing the classification of the data set, 
the  contamination  sites  were  mapped.  K-means 
was executed on both the original concentrations 
(Figure 9) and the log-normal (Figure 8) concentra-
tions. 

 
Figure  8:  Geographical  Mapping  of  Contamination 
Sites (Log-Normal) 

 
Figure  9:  Geographical  Mapping  of  Contamination  Sites 
(Normal) 
As seen in Figures 8 and 9, there is no clear geo-
graphical basis for the clustering of natural or un-
natural contamination. Therefore, the source of the 
contamination  cannot  be  determined  from  the 
provided data.

6. Conclusion 
From  the  analyses  of  the  data  with  respect  to 
classification,  it  can  be  stated  with  high  confi-
dence that the McConnell Air Force Base has ap-
parent  soil  contamination.  This  contamination  is 
characterized by especially high concentrations of 
Barium,  Mercury,  and  Lead.  The  source  of  the 
contamination is yet unknown, given the provided 
data, but may be related to depth of soil sample 
or specific site operations. 
 
7. Future Endeavors 
Classification of soil sample contamination is one 
that is constantly undergoing change. Most avail-
able data uses hierarchical classification to deter-
mine  clusters  of  samples,  along  with  principal 
component analysis.  
In future work, I would like to investigate the accu-
racy  of  hierarchical  classifications,  using  either 
principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  or  independ-
ent  component  analysis  (ICA).  These  reductions 
primarily differ in the assumption of Gaussian fea-
tures, or lack thereof. I would like to compare the 
classifications from those strategies and models to 
those achieved from k-means, as done in this re-
port.
