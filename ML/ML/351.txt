Mitochondria are integral to proper cell func-

tion, and mutations in its small genome
(mtDNA) are associated with many diseases,
along with the progression of normal aging [9].
While mtDNA has been extensively studied, not
much is known about transcriptional variations of
mitochondrial genes [3]. Recently, tRNA modiﬁ-
cations have been the focus of intense study ow-
ing to their putative role in diseases [4].
Identi-
fying genes responsible for mitochondrial tRNA
modiﬁcation is an important step towards a bet-
ter understanding of transcriptional variation. To
the best of my knowledge, a machine learning ap-
proach has never been utilized in order to identify
such genes. Here, I used penalized linear regres-
sion to predict tRNA modiﬁcation activity using
gene expression as features. After controlling for
confounding factors, I was able to predict modiﬁ-
cation activity at several putative modiﬁed tRNA
positions. These models explained between 19%
and 51% of the variance. Most notably, I used
preconditioned lasso [7] which yielded four promis-
ing gene candidates that aﬀect tRNA modiﬁca-
tion: ALKBH8 (an E. coli homolog DNA repair
enzyme), MAD2L1 Binding Protein, C1orf103 (an
open reading frame gene with unknown function),
and TRMT5 (tRNA methyltransferase 5).

Introduction

Central Dogma of Biology

In 1956, Francis Crick is credited with ﬁrst articulating
the ﬂow of sequencing information in a cell known as the
Central Dogma of Biology [1]. Essentially, this Dogma
states that DNA sequence (which serves as data storage)
is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA transcripts) and
later translated into proteins, which are nano-scale ma-
chines that do most of the functional work in the cell. This
ﬂow of information provides several points in which the
cell can regulate production of protein, the most studied
of which being gene transcription. However, since then sci-
entists have discovered mechanisms by which mRNA tran-
scripts are postranscriptionally modiﬁed, which can have
downstream eﬀects on protein expression. These kinds of
RNA modiﬁcations are typically studied in nuclear genes,
and have not been well characterized in mitochondrial
RNA transcripts. However, because of the mitochondrion’s
unique mechanism of gene transcription and translation, I
will argue that certain RNA modiﬁcations can have signiﬁ-
cant downstream functional eﬀects.

Mitochondrial Punctuation Model

Independent of nuclear DNA, mitochondria have their own
genome (mtDNA), which is circular (similar to bacterial
genomes), 16,569 base pairs long, and contains 37 genes
which consist of 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins in-
volved with the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (see
ﬁgure 1)1. Mitochondria are not self-suﬃcient and rely
on many proteins encoded by the nuclear genome. When
the mitochondria transcribe the genes located in mtDNA,
they produce three polycistronic (transcripts with more
than one gene) mRNA sequences where the coding pro-
teins are separated (or punctuated) by tRNA genes. These
tRNA (or transfer RNA) genes are diﬀerent from mRNA
because they are not translated, but instead tRNAs aid
in the translation process, by helping ribosomes construct
proteins from amino acids. However, in the mitochondrion,
tRNAs likely have a second function. Scientists hypothe-
size that the clover-like structure of tRNA regions in the
polycistronic reads serve as a binding site for nuclear en-
coded cleaving proteins that separate the mitochondrial
genes from the polycistronic read allowing them to con-
tinue through the process of translation [6]. Given the
importance of tRNA structure in the punctuation model of
mitochondrial gene translation, it is plausible that modiﬁ-
cations of tRNA structure could aﬀect protein translation
and functional properties of the mitochondrion. In fact,
Liu et al., showed that perturbing the editing activity of a
tRNA modiﬁer protein resulted in defects of mitochondrial
function in cardiomyocytes [4].

tissue or cell sample, a scientist can decode all the DNA
and RNA into a human readable format (G,C, T, A, and
RNA have a special base pair represented as U instead of
T). The output of sequencing are millions of reads that
consist of strings of nucleotide base pairs (typically between
75-150) which represent discrete chunks of molecules of
genetic information. Researchers then assemble these reads
like a jigsaw puzzle (reads typically have some overlap be-
tween each other), and the number of reads that align to a
speciﬁc position in a genome represent the conﬁdence with
which they predict a speciﬁc base pair to be located there.
In addition to obtaining decoded genetic information, by
comparing DNA sequencing to RNA sequencing data, sci-
entists can identify modiﬁed RNA positions. For example,
if DNA sequencing conﬁdently predicts the presence of an
A at a speciﬁc position, and RNA sequencing instead (but
also conﬁdently) predicts the presence of a G at that same
base pair, then the evidence suggests that after transcrip-
tion the RNA position was modiﬁed. Hogdkinson et al. [3],
compared mitochondrial DNA and RNA sequencing data
from a Canadian population of nearly 1000 individuals to
identify RNA modiﬁcation events. At eleven positions of
mitochondrial tRNA (speciﬁcally p9 positions) they found
systematic signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the DNA and
RNA predicted base pair, and from this evidence they
hypothesized the presence of a RNA modiﬁcation event at
these positions. To quantify the amount of tRNA modiﬁ-
cation, they used the RNA sequencing data and calculated
the ratio of read counts that predicted the usual base pair
at that position and the number of reads that predicted
the modiﬁed nucleotide. For example, if we look at a read
distributions at one of mitochondria’s tRNA positions, let’s
say the DNA sequencing data has 1000 reads that align to
A and zero reads that align to the other nucleotides (repre-
senting a high likelihood that the position is an adenosine),
however the RNA sequencing data at this same position
has 400 reads aligned to A, 200 reads to C, 200 reads to G,
and 200 to U. Then, a surrogate for the quantity of RNA
modiﬁcation would be the alternative allele frequency, in
our example case:

200 + 200 + 200

200 + 200 + 200 + 400

= 0.6

The premise is that during RNA sequencing, modiﬁed bases
are not correctly identiﬁed, but instead are stochastically
misread as diﬀerent nucleotides. With a summary statistic
for tRNA modiﬁcation in place we must ﬁnd a way to
identify genes responsible for this mechanism.

Genes Involved with tRNA Modiﬁcation

The prototypical method for identifying genes associated
with a phenotypic trait is called a genome-wide association
study (GWAS). When performing a GWAS, the researcher
must associate single nucleotide mutations (referred to as
SNPs) to the trait of interest. Let’s say we are studying
diabetes and are interested in genes that are correlated
with blood glucose levels. A GWAS is an iterative search
for SNPs that signiﬁcantly aﬀect the trait of interest, so
maybe a interesting target would be a gene where individ-
uals that have a G in one of the positions instead of a C

base pair are more likely to have elevated blood glucose
levels. Hodgekinson et al., calculated a RNA modiﬁcation
summary statistic for all the putatively modiﬁed tRNA
positions in each of the nearly 1000 individuals, and then
performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to
identify SNP genotypes associated with variations of RNA
modiﬁcation. They found several signiﬁcant hits, the most
signiﬁcant hit was located in the MRPP3 gene region that
encodes for a protein associated with the mitochondria and
methylation activity.

This work ties tRNA modiﬁcation to a biological mecha-
nism, however GWAS tend to identify genomic regions of
interest at a low resolution, and it is quite possible that
not all genes responsible for variations of tRNA modiﬁ-
cation were identiﬁed. Instead of performing a GWAS,
I utilized a machine learning approach to predict tRNA
modiﬁcation values, and identiﬁed genes of interest using
feature selection. In this context, my feature matrix will
consist of p protein coding gene expression values for n
observations, and the continuous response variables are the
tRNA modiﬁcation summary statistics.

Materials & Methods
To construct my feature matrix and response variables, I
used data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
project. The current data freeze has fastq (sequence read
format) and bam (sequence read format after aligned to
the genome) ﬁles located on the Stanford Genetics depart-
ment cluster, scg3. I analyzed 3,203 whole transcriptome
RNAseq samples from 212 individuals and 30 diﬀerent
tissues.

sent data sources, and the red boxes are data processing

Data Processing

The reads contained in the fastq ﬁles are aligned (jigsaw
puzzle solving process relying on read overlap) to the hg19
reference genome concatenated with the rCRS mitochon-
drial reference genome2 using TopHat (a popular short read
aligner that is aware of gene splicing). Flux capacitor then
processes the aligned reads to extract gene expression val-
ues (in RPKM units) per gene. Finally, I use the samtools
package to calculate the modiﬁcation summary statistic
of the eleven previously identiﬁed p9 tRNA positions de-
scribed in Hodgkinson et al., (585, 1610, 2617, 4271, 5520,

2Over millions of years fragments of mtDNA have been inserted into
the nuclear genome, these fragments are called nuclear mitochondrial
genes (NUMTs). Thus, alignment of the reads to both the nuclear
and mitochondrial genome is important to avoid false mapping of
NUMT reads to the mitochondria.

See ﬁgure 2 for the ﬂow diagram of data processing.

Due to quality control concerns (low coverage), I re-
stricted my analysis to only four tRNA positions: 2617,
13710, 14734, 12274. Also, I calculated two meta-response
variables, one was the average summary statistic for the
four selected tRNA positions, and the other was mean sum-
mary statistic over all the tRNA positions (including the
low-quality base predictions). My gene expression feature
matrix was restricted to protein coding genes (as identiﬁed
by Gencode annotation) that are diﬀerentially expressed
in the samples (i.e., the variance of gene expression values
is greater than 0). This process narrows down the number
of features from over 55,000 to 18,780 genes.

From the total set of observations I randomly selected
20% of the observations (or 641 samples) to use as a test
set after generating the prediction model. I normalized
both the gene expression values and response variable of
the training set to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1 by
subtracting each gene’s respective mean and dividing by
each each gene’s respective variance. To normalize the test
data, I centered and scaled the values by the mean and
variance of the training set’s respective gene or response
variable’s mean and variance. This process allows me to
keep the test data independent from the training set and
still normalize the data under the assumption that the
values were produced from the same distribution.

In addition to regressing on the expression values, I con-
trolled for known confounders by performing regression
with GTEx metadata. This included metadata such as:
height, weight, gender, age, batch id (samples sequenced
separately could have diﬀerent QC characteristics), and tis-
sue, which were all located on the scg3 server. Controlling
for confounding variables is an essential step that removes
extra noise from the signal.

Model Generation & Feature Selection
Regularized Linear Regression

The goal is to ﬁnd the vector of β coeﬃcients that mini-
mizes the objective function. On the left we see the familiar
linear regression objective, and on the right we have both
the L1 and L2 norm of the β coeﬃcients, which represents
the penalty. When optimizing the objective function there
are two parameters to select, λ, which controls the strength
of the penalty, and α that controls the proportion of the L1
or L2 norm that is mixed into our regularization penalty.
I performed 10-fold cross validation on the training set
to select the optimal λ value, and I set α to 1, which is

referred to as lasso regression. I chose to use lasso regres-
sion, as opposed to ridge regression (α set to 0 resulting
in less sparse solutions) or elastic net (α set to between 0
and 1, resulting in coeﬃcient sparsity between lasso and
ridge regression), because I prefer a sparser solution (lasso
tends to shrink coeﬃcients to 0), and accuracy gains made
by varying α were minimal. Models were evaluated by
calculating the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the pre-
diction and the response variable, and relying on variance
explained as a metric for determining the amount of signal
captured, calculated by

1 − var(ˆy)
var(y)

where y is the original response and ˆy is the regression
residual.

Controlling for Covariates

Originally, my model explained tRNA modiﬁcation as a
function of gene expression and random standard gaussian
distributed noise or

y ∼ expression + 

however, this does not take into account known covariates
that could confound the signal. To identify metadata
correlated with the response variable, I modiﬁed my model
so that tRNA modiﬁcation is a result of a linear function
of batch id, tissue, gene expression and random standard
gaussian distributed noise or

y ∼ batch + tissue + expression + 

The other metadata values did not have much predictive
power so they were excluded. To observe the quantity
of signal loss, I ﬁrst ran regression on the metadata then
regressed the gene expression values on the residuals.

Tissue-Speciﬁc Models

In an attempt to minimize the amount of signal lossage
when I regress out tissue-speciﬁc eﬀects, I generated sev-
eral models, separately, using only the more numerous
single tissue types. Speciﬁcally, I generated models using
observations from brain, skin, blood, and muscle, of which
there were 424, 347, 271, and 176 respective samples. Once
again, I held out 20% for testing. In the results section,
for brevity, I only include analysis on the model generated
with muscle tissue samples.

Training Set Size Analysis

To evaluate instability of training a model on a smaller
data set, I performed a training set size analysis. This
consisted of iteratively training lasso models on a training
sets of sizes 100 to 2600 by increments of 100 observations,
and testing the generated model on a test set of size 600.

Preconditioning Lasso

While successfully predicting tRNA modiﬁcation was one
of this project’s main goals, it was equally important to
identify a subset of genes that putatively aﬀect mitochon-
drial tRNA modiﬁcation. Preconditioning lasso is a method
used in high-dimensional problems and can reduce negative

(cid:3)

Since the number of features (approximately 18,000 diﬀer-
entially expressed protein coding genes) far outnumbers
the number of observations (3,203 GTEx RNAseq sam-
ples), linear regression is not feasible.
Instead, I used
the glmnet package in R which implements a mixture of
L1 and L2 penalized linear regression by optimizing the
following objective function:

Introduction

Central Dogma of Biology

In 1956, Francis Crick is credited with ﬁrst articulating
the ﬂow of sequencing information in a cell known as the
Central Dogma of Biology [1]. Essentially, this Dogma
states that DNA sequence (which serves as data storage)
is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA transcripts) and
later translated into proteins, which are nano-scale ma-
chines that do most of the functional work in the cell. This
ﬂow of information provides several points in which the
cell can regulate production of protein, the most studied
of which being gene transcription. However, since then sci-
entists have discovered mechanisms by which mRNA tran-
scripts are postranscriptionally modiﬁed, which can have
downstream eﬀects on protein expression. These kinds of
RNA modiﬁcations are typically studied in nuclear genes,
and have not been well characterized in mitochondrial
RNA transcripts. However, because of the mitochondrion’s
unique mechanism of gene transcription and translation, I
will argue that certain RNA modiﬁcations can have signiﬁ-
cant downstream functional eﬀects.

Mitochondrial Punctuation Model

Independent of nuclear DNA, mitochondria have their own
genome (mtDNA), which is circular (similar to bacterial
genomes), 16,569 base pairs long, and contains 37 genes
which consist of 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins in-
volved with the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (see
ﬁgure 1)1. Mitochondria are not self-suﬃcient and rely
on many proteins encoded by the nuclear genome. When
the mitochondria transcribe the genes located in mtDNA,
they produce three polycistronic (transcripts with more
than one gene) mRNA sequences where the coding pro-
teins are separated (or punctuated) by tRNA genes. These
tRNA (or transfer RNA) genes are diﬀerent from mRNA
because they are not translated, but instead tRNAs aid
in the translation process, by helping ribosomes construct
proteins from amino acids. However, in the mitochondrion,
tRNAs likely have a second function. Scientists hypothe-
size that the clover-like structure of tRNA regions in the
polycistronic reads serve as a binding site for nuclear en-
coded cleaving proteins that separate the mitochondrial
genes from the polycistronic read allowing them to con-
tinue through the process of translation [6]. Given the
importance of tRNA structure in the punctuation model of
mitochondrial gene translation, it is plausible that modiﬁ-
cations of tRNA structure could aﬀect protein translation
and functional properties of the mitochondrion. In fact,
Liu et al., showed that perturbing the editing activity of a
tRNA modiﬁer protein resulted in defects of mitochondrial
function in cardiomyocytes [4].

ments in the technology used to decode DNA (DNAseq)
and RNA (RNAseq) sequencing reads. By sequencing a

tissue or cell sample, a scientist can decode all the DNA
and RNA into a human readable format (G,C, T, A, and
RNA have a special base pair represented as U instead of
T). The output of sequencing are millions of reads that
consist of strings of nucleotide base pairs (typically between
75-150) which represent discrete chunks of molecules of
genetic information. Researchers then assemble these reads
like a jigsaw puzzle (reads typically have some overlap be-
tween each other), and the number of reads that align to a
speciﬁc position in a genome represent the conﬁdence with
which they predict a speciﬁc base pair to be located there.
In addition to obtaining decoded genetic information, by
comparing DNA sequencing to RNA sequencing data, sci-
entists can identify modiﬁed RNA positions. For example,
if DNA sequencing conﬁdently predicts the presence of an
A at a speciﬁc position, and RNA sequencing instead (but
also conﬁdently) predicts the presence of a G at that same
base pair, then the evidence suggests that after transcrip-
tion the RNA position was modiﬁed. Hogdkinson et al. [3],
compared mitochondrial DNA and RNA sequencing data
from a Canadian population of nearly 1000 individuals to
identify RNA modiﬁcation events. At eleven positions of
mitochondrial tRNA (speciﬁcally p9 positions) they found
systematic signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the DNA and
RNA predicted base pair, and from this evidence they
hypothesized the presence of a RNA modiﬁcation event at
these positions. To quantify the amount of tRNA modiﬁ-
cation, they used the RNA sequencing data and calculated
the ratio of read counts that predicted the usual base pair
at that position and the number of reads that predicted
the modiﬁed nucleotide. For example, if we look at a read
distributions at one of mitochondria’s tRNA positions, let’s
say the DNA sequencing data has 1000 reads that align to
A and zero reads that align to the other nucleotides (repre-
senting a high likelihood that the position is an adenosine),
however the RNA sequencing data at this same position
has 400 reads aligned to A, 200 reads to C, 200 reads to G,
and 200 to U. Then, a surrogate for the quantity of RNA
modiﬁcation would be the alternative allele frequency, in
our example case:

200 + 200 + 200

200 + 200 + 200 + 400

= 0.6

The premise is that during RNA sequencing, modiﬁed bases
are not correctly identiﬁed, but instead are stochastically
misread as diﬀerent nucleotides. With a summary statistic
for tRNA modiﬁcation in place we must ﬁnd a way to
identify genes responsible for this mechanism.

Genes Involved with tRNA Modiﬁcation

The prototypical method for identifying genes associated
with a phenotypic trait is called a genome-wide association
study (GWAS). When performing a GWAS, the researcher
must associate single nucleotide mutations (referred to as
SNPs) to the trait of interest. Let’s say we are studying
diabetes and are interested in genes that are correlated
with blood glucose levels. A GWAS is an iterative search
for SNPs that signiﬁcantly aﬀect the trait of interest, so
maybe a interesting target would be a gene where individ-
uals that have a G in one of the positions instead of a C

base pair are more likely to have elevated blood glucose
levels. Hodgekinson et al., calculated a RNA modiﬁcation
summary statistic for all the putatively modiﬁed tRNA
positions in each of the nearly 1000 individuals, and then
performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to
identify SNP genotypes associated with variations of RNA
modiﬁcation. They found several signiﬁcant hits, the most
signiﬁcant hit was located in the MRPP3 gene region that
encodes for a protein associated with the mitochondria and
methylation activity.

This work ties tRNA modiﬁcation to a biological mecha-
nism, however GWAS tend to identify genomic regions of
interest at a low resolution, and it is quite possible that
not all genes responsible for variations of tRNA modiﬁ-
cation were identiﬁed. Instead of performing a GWAS,
I utilized a machine learning approach to predict tRNA
modiﬁcation values, and identiﬁed genes of interest using
feature selection. In this context, my feature matrix will
consist of p protein coding gene expression values for n
observations, and the continuous response variables are the
tRNA modiﬁcation summary statistics.

Materials & Methods
To construct my feature matrix and response variables, I
used data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
project. The current data freeze has fastq (sequence read
format) and bam (sequence read format after aligned to
the genome) ﬁles located on the Stanford Genetics depart-
ment cluster, scg3. I analyzed 3,203 whole transcriptome
RNAseq samples from 212 individuals and 30 diﬀerent
tissues.

sent data sources, and the red boxes are data processing

Data Processing

The reads contained in the fastq ﬁles are aligned (jigsaw
puzzle solving process relying on read overlap) to the hg19
reference genome concatenated with the rCRS mitochon-
drial reference genome2 using TopHat (a popular short read
aligner that is aware of gene splicing). Flux capacitor then
processes the aligned reads to extract gene expression val-
ues (in RPKM units) per gene. Finally, I use the samtools
package to calculate the modiﬁcation summary statistic
of the eleven previously identiﬁed p9 tRNA positions de-
scribed in Hodgkinson et al., (585, 1610, 2617, 4271, 5520,

2Over millions of years fragments of mtDNA have been inserted into
the nuclear genome, these fragments are called nuclear mitochondrial
genes (NUMTs). Thus, alignment of the reads to both the nuclear
and mitochondrial genome is important to avoid false mapping of
NUMT reads to the mitochondria.

See ﬁgure 2 for the ﬂow diagram of data processing.

Due to quality control concerns (low coverage), I re-
stricted my analysis to only four tRNA positions: 2617,
13710, 14734, 12274. Also, I calculated two meta-response
variables, one was the average summary statistic for the
four selected tRNA positions, and the other was mean sum-
mary statistic over all the tRNA positions (including the
low-quality base predictions). My gene expression feature
matrix was restricted to protein coding genes (as identiﬁed
by Gencode annotation) that are diﬀerentially expressed
in the samples (i.e., the variance of gene expression values
is greater than 0). This process narrows down the number
of features from over 55,000 to 18,780 genes.

From the total set of observations I randomly selected
20% of the observations (or 641 samples) to use as a test
set after generating the prediction model. I normalized
both the gene expression values and response variable of
the training set to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1 by
subtracting each gene’s respective mean and dividing by
each each gene’s respective variance. To normalize the test
data, I centered and scaled the values by the mean and
variance of the training set’s respective gene or response
variable’s mean and variance. This process allows me to
keep the test data independent from the training set and
still normalize the data under the assumption that the
values were produced from the same distribution.

In addition to regressing on the expression values, I con-
trolled for known confounders by performing regression
with GTEx metadata. This included metadata such as:
height, weight, gender, age, batch id (samples sequenced
separately could have diﬀerent QC characteristics), and tis-
sue, which were all located on the scg3 server. Controlling
for confounding variables is an essential step that removes
extra noise from the signal.

Model Generation & Feature Selection
Regularized Linear Regression

The goal is to ﬁnd the vector of β coeﬃcients that mini-
mizes the objective function. On the left we see the familiar
linear regression objective, and on the right we have both
the L1 and L2 norm of the β coeﬃcients, which represents
the penalty. When optimizing the objective function there
are two parameters to select, λ, which controls the strength
of the penalty, and α that controls the proportion of the L1
or L2 norm that is mixed into our regularization penalty.
I performed 10-fold cross validation on the training set
to select the optimal λ value, and I set α to 1, which is

referred to as lasso regression. I chose to use lasso regres-
sion, as opposed to ridge regression (α set to 0 resulting
in less sparse solutions) or elastic net (α set to between 0
and 1, resulting in coeﬃcient sparsity between lasso and
ridge regression), because I prefer a sparser solution (lasso
tends to shrink coeﬃcients to 0), and accuracy gains made
by varying α were minimal. Models were evaluated by
calculating the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the pre-
diction and the response variable, and relying on variance
explained as a metric for determining the amount of signal
captured, calculated by

1 − var(ˆy)
var(y)

where y is the original response and ˆy is the regression
residual.

Controlling for Covariates

Originally, my model explained tRNA modiﬁcation as a
function of gene expression and random standard gaussian
distributed noise or

y ∼ expression + 

however, this does not take into account known covariates
that could confound the signal. To identify metadata
correlated with the response variable, I modiﬁed my model
so that tRNA modiﬁcation is a result of a linear function
of batch id, tissue, gene expression and random standard
gaussian distributed noise or

y ∼ batch + tissue + expression + 

The other metadata values did not have much predictive
power so they were excluded. To observe the quantity
of signal loss, I ﬁrst ran regression on the metadata then
regressed the gene expression values on the residuals.

Tissue-Speciﬁc Models

In an attempt to minimize the amount of signal lossage
when I regress out tissue-speciﬁc eﬀects, I generated sev-
eral models, separately, using only the more numerous
single tissue types. Speciﬁcally, I generated models using
observations from brain, skin, blood, and muscle, of which
there were 424, 347, 271, and 176 respective samples. Once
again, I held out 20% for testing. In the results section,
for brevity, I only include analysis on the model generated
with muscle tissue samples.

Training Set Size Analysis

To evaluate instability of training a model on a smaller
data set, I performed a training set size analysis. This
consisted of iteratively training lasso models on a training
sets of sizes 100 to 2600 by increments of 100 observations,
and testing the generated model on a test set of size 600.

Preconditioning Lasso

While successfully predicting tRNA modiﬁcation was one
of this project’s main goals, it was equally important to
identify a subset of genes that putatively aﬀect mitochon-
drial tRNA modiﬁcation. Preconditioning lasso is a method
used in high-dimensional problems and can reduce negative

(cid:3)

Since the number of features (approximately 18,000 diﬀer-
entially expressed protein coding genes) far outnumbers
the number of observations (3,203 GTEx RNAseq sam-
ples), linear regression is not feasible.
Instead, I used
the glmnet package in R which implements a mixture of
L1 and L2 penalized linear regression by optimizing the
following objective function:

eﬀects of a noisy response variable under the assumption of
a latent variable model, as described in [7]. This method
eﬀectively balances the tradeoﬀ between low test-error rate
from supervised PCA and sparse lasso solutions [2].

The ﬁrst step of this method is to run supervised Prin-
cipal Components (which is implemented in the superpc
package in R). Brieﬂy, this consists of calculating univariate
regression coeﬃcients for each of the normalized features,
and then for several monotonically increasing threshold
values, we calculate the ﬁrst m principal components (PCs)
on a subset feature matrix consisting of all variables with
larger absolute value univariate coeﬃcients than the spec-
iﬁed threshold (going through the list of thresholds iter-
atively), and using these PCs in a regression model to
predict the outcome. Threshold values and m are selected
using cross validation.

After we select the m most signiﬁcant PCs (constructed
from features with coeﬃcients greater than the selected
threshold value), we generate a predicted response variable
from all the training set observations, and ﬁnally run lasso
(with all the features) to try and predict the response
variables generated with supervised PCA.

Results & Discussion
Regularized Regression & Controlling for Covariates

The ﬁrst training and test set error rates were calculated
using a model generated with batch id and tissue metadata
information, while the second set was calculated using the
residuals after controlling for tissue and batch (see table 1).
Metadata was best able to explain tRNA modiﬁcation
at position 13710, and least capable at position 12274.
Strangely, the latter position had a lower test error rate
than training error rate. For most of the positions there
was a disparity between the metadata predicted training
and testing error rate, signifying that there was still some
overﬁtting occurring. This could be the case because batch
id is a categorical variable and it is possible that there
were not enough samples in a single batch to form a useful
model.

After removing batch and tissue eﬀect confounding, we
see more modest decreases in error rate (columns labeled
with 2 in table 1). The biggest decrease in error rate was
at position 14734 for both the training set and the test
set. However, once again there was a disparity between
training and test set error.

Tissue-Speciﬁc Models

Visualizing predictions compared to the top 4 base pair
averaged response, we see a dramatic decrease in linear-
ity after controlling for confounding factors (ﬁgure 3A to
B). While controlling for batch is obviously beneﬁcial, I
hypothesized that some of the noise removed when I con-
trolled by tissue also removed some of the signal. Thus,
I created several models using single tissues, which, are
more genetically homogenous. Figure 3 shows the results
of generating a model using 118 muscle samples. Notice
that from 3C to 3D, we see that less signal is lost, however
the R2 values are quite low. This is likely the case because
there are simply not enough training observations.

Training Set Size Analysis

To explore this idea further, I generated lasso models pre-
dicting the top 4 base pair averaged response using increas-
ing numbers of observations as a training set and testing
on a ﬁxed test set of 600 observations. Figure 4 shows
the results of 10 replicate runs over 26 diﬀerent training
set values. As the number of training set observations in-
creases, we see that the training set and test set mean error
converge, however they both plateau at approximately 0.4.
For the previous muscle tissue analysis, the model would
be towards the left side of ﬁgure 4, thus explaining the lack
of an appropriate ﬁt.

ing set size, plotted in y and x-axis, respectively.

Preconditioned Lasso

Each of the models I described previously had, on average,
200 features, even though I chose lasso for its tendency to
produce sparse solutions. For predicting the amount of
tRNA modiﬁcation this is ﬁne, however for gene validation
I need a method of reducing or ranking these genes of
interest to something more manageable. For this reason, I
ran preconditioned lasso.

After removing batch and tissue eﬀects, running precon-
ditioned lasso using the top 4 base pair average response
resulted in a training error rate of 0.4 and a test error rate
of 0.6, from a model with only four gene features. While
this method did not produce as low of a training error rate,
the disparity with the test error decreased signiﬁcantly, a
sign of less overﬁtting. In addition, four gene features is a
manageable list of interesting genes. The four genes were
(in decreasing order of model coeﬃcient size): ALKBH8,
MAD2L1BP, C1orf103, and TRMT5. ALKBH8 is an alky-
lated DNA repair protein homolog, with known tRNA

See ﬁgure 2 for the ﬂow diagram of data processing.

Due to quality control concerns (low coverage), I re-
stricted my analysis to only four tRNA positions: 2617,
13710, 14734, 12274. Also, I calculated two meta-response
variables, one was the average summary statistic for the
four selected tRNA positions, and the other was mean sum-
mary statistic over all the tRNA positions (including the
low-quality base predictions). My gene expression feature
matrix was restricted to protein coding genes (as identiﬁed
by Gencode annotation) that are diﬀerentially expressed
in the samples (i.e., the variance of gene expression values
is greater than 0). This process narrows down the number
of features from over 55,000 to 18,780 genes.

From the total set of observations I randomly selected
20% of the observations (or 641 samples) to use as a test
set after generating the prediction model. I normalized
both the gene expression values and response variable of
the training set to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1 by
subtracting each gene’s respective mean and dividing by
each each gene’s respective variance. To normalize the test
data, I centered and scaled the values by the mean and
variance of the training set’s respective gene or response
variable’s mean and variance. This process allows me to
keep the test data independent from the training set and
still normalize the data under the assumption that the
values were produced from the same distribution.

In addition to regressing on the expression values, I con-
trolled for known confounders by performing regression
with GTEx metadata. This included metadata such as:
height, weight, gender, age, batch id (samples sequenced
separately could have diﬀerent QC characteristics), and tis-
sue, which were all located on the scg3 server. Controlling
for confounding variables is an essential step that removes
extra noise from the signal.

Model Generation & Feature Selection
Regularized Linear Regression

The goal is to ﬁnd the vector of β coeﬃcients that mini-
mizes the objective function. On the left we see the familiar
linear regression objective, and on the right we have both
the L1 and L2 norm of the β coeﬃcients, which represents
the penalty. When optimizing the objective function there
are two parameters to select, λ, which controls the strength
of the penalty, and α that controls the proportion of the L1
or L2 norm that is mixed into our regularization penalty.
I performed 10-fold cross validation on the training set
to select the optimal λ value, and I set α to 1, which is

referred to as lasso regression. I chose to use lasso regres-
sion, as opposed to ridge regression (α set to 0 resulting
in less sparse solutions) or elastic net (α set to between 0
and 1, resulting in coeﬃcient sparsity between lasso and
ridge regression), because I prefer a sparser solution (lasso
tends to shrink coeﬃcients to 0), and accuracy gains made
by varying α were minimal. Models were evaluated by
calculating the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the pre-
diction and the response variable, and relying on variance
explained as a metric for determining the amount of signal
captured, calculated by

1 − var(ˆy)
var(y)

where y is the original response and ˆy is the regression
residual.

Controlling for Covariates

Originally, my model explained tRNA modiﬁcation as a
function of gene expression and random standard gaussian
distributed noise or

y ∼ expression + 

however, this does not take into account known covariates
that could confound the signal. To identify metadata
correlated with the response variable, I modiﬁed my model
so that tRNA modiﬁcation is a result of a linear function
of batch id, tissue, gene expression and random standard
gaussian distributed noise or

y ∼ batch + tissue + expression + 

The other metadata values did not have much predictive
power so they were excluded. To observe the quantity
of signal loss, I ﬁrst ran regression on the metadata then
regressed the gene expression values on the residuals.

Tissue-Speciﬁc Models

In an attempt to minimize the amount of signal lossage
when I regress out tissue-speciﬁc eﬀects, I generated sev-
eral models, separately, using only the more numerous
single tissue types. Speciﬁcally, I generated models using
observations from brain, skin, blood, and muscle, of which
there were 424, 347, 271, and 176 respective samples. Once
again, I held out 20% for testing. In the results section,
for brevity, I only include analysis on the model generated
with muscle tissue samples.

Training Set Size Analysis

To evaluate instability of training a model on a smaller
data set, I performed a training set size analysis. This
consisted of iteratively training lasso models on a training
sets of sizes 100 to 2600 by increments of 100 observations,
and testing the generated model on a test set of size 600.

Preconditioning Lasso

While successfully predicting tRNA modiﬁcation was one
of this project’s main goals, it was equally important to
identify a subset of genes that putatively aﬀect mitochon-
drial tRNA modiﬁcation. Preconditioning lasso is a method
used in high-dimensional problems and can reduce negative

(cid:3)

Since the number of features (approximately 18,000 diﬀer-
entially expressed protein coding genes) far outnumbers
the number of observations (3,203 GTEx RNAseq sam-
ples), linear regression is not feasible.
Instead, I used
the glmnet package in R which implements a mixture of
L1 and L2 penalized linear regression by optimizing the
following objective function:

eﬀects of a noisy response variable under the assumption of
a latent variable model, as described in [7]. This method
eﬀectively balances the tradeoﬀ between low test-error rate
from supervised PCA and sparse lasso solutions [2].

The ﬁrst step of this method is to run supervised Prin-
cipal Components (which is implemented in the superpc
package in R). Brieﬂy, this consists of calculating univariate
regression coeﬃcients for each of the normalized features,
and then for several monotonically increasing threshold
values, we calculate the ﬁrst m principal components (PCs)
on a subset feature matrix consisting of all variables with
larger absolute value univariate coeﬃcients than the spec-
iﬁed threshold (going through the list of thresholds iter-
atively), and using these PCs in a regression model to
predict the outcome. Threshold values and m are selected
using cross validation.

After we select the m most signiﬁcant PCs (constructed
from features with coeﬃcients greater than the selected
threshold value), we generate a predicted response variable
from all the training set observations, and ﬁnally run lasso
(with all the features) to try and predict the response
variables generated with supervised PCA.

Results & Discussion
Regularized Regression & Controlling for Covariates

The ﬁrst training and test set error rates were calculated
using a model generated with batch id and tissue metadata
information, while the second set was calculated using the
residuals after controlling for tissue and batch (see table 1).
Metadata was best able to explain tRNA modiﬁcation
at position 13710, and least capable at position 12274.
Strangely, the latter position had a lower test error rate
than training error rate. For most of the positions there
was a disparity between the metadata predicted training
and testing error rate, signifying that there was still some
overﬁtting occurring. This could be the case because batch
id is a categorical variable and it is possible that there
were not enough samples in a single batch to form a useful
model.

After removing batch and tissue eﬀect confounding, we
see more modest decreases in error rate (columns labeled
with 2 in table 1). The biggest decrease in error rate was
at position 14734 for both the training set and the test
set. However, once again there was a disparity between
training and test set error.

Tissue-Speciﬁc Models

Visualizing predictions compared to the top 4 base pair
averaged response, we see a dramatic decrease in linear-
ity after controlling for confounding factors (ﬁgure 3A to
B). While controlling for batch is obviously beneﬁcial, I
hypothesized that some of the noise removed when I con-
trolled by tissue also removed some of the signal. Thus,
I created several models using single tissues, which, are
more genetically homogenous. Figure 3 shows the results
of generating a model using 118 muscle samples. Notice
that from 3C to 3D, we see that less signal is lost, however
the R2 values are quite low. This is likely the case because
there are simply not enough training observations.

Training Set Size Analysis

To explore this idea further, I generated lasso models pre-
dicting the top 4 base pair averaged response using increas-
ing numbers of observations as a training set and testing
on a ﬁxed test set of 600 observations. Figure 4 shows
the results of 10 replicate runs over 26 diﬀerent training
set values. As the number of training set observations in-
creases, we see that the training set and test set mean error
converge, however they both plateau at approximately 0.4.
For the previous muscle tissue analysis, the model would
be towards the left side of ﬁgure 4, thus explaining the lack
of an appropriate ﬁt.

ing set size, plotted in y and x-axis, respectively.

Preconditioned Lasso

Each of the models I described previously had, on average,
200 features, even though I chose lasso for its tendency to
produce sparse solutions. For predicting the amount of
tRNA modiﬁcation this is ﬁne, however for gene validation
I need a method of reducing or ranking these genes of
interest to something more manageable. For this reason, I
ran preconditioned lasso.

After removing batch and tissue eﬀects, running precon-
ditioned lasso using the top 4 base pair average response
resulted in a training error rate of 0.4 and a test error rate
of 0.6, from a model with only four gene features. While
this method did not produce as low of a training error rate,
the disparity with the test error decreased signiﬁcantly, a
sign of less overﬁtting. In addition, four gene features is a
manageable list of interesting genes. The four genes were
(in decreasing order of model coeﬃcient size): ALKBH8,
MAD2L1BP, C1orf103, and TRMT5. ALKBH8 is an alky-
lated DNA repair protein homolog, with known tRNA

modiﬁcation functionality. In fact, there is a paper titled,
“ALKBH8-mediated formation of a novel diastereomeric
pair of wobble nucleosides in mammalian tRNA”. Also,
it appears as though other homologs of ALKBH8 have
mitochondria speciﬁc activity. MAD2L1BP is a protein
that binds to MAD2L1, a cell cycle regulator, otherwise
not much known is about it, however it does localize to the
mitochondria3. Again, not much is known about C1orf103,
the name itself simply stands for Chromosome 1 Open
Reading Frame. Finally, there is TRMT5, which stands for
tRNA methyltransferase 5 homolog. According to Suzuki
et al., TRMT5 has a yeast homolog that modiﬁes tRNAs
in the cytoplasm and mitochondria in yeast, and thus is
suspected to play a role in mitochondrial function.
Conclusions & Future work
Models generated with lasso achieved varying degrees of
success in predicting the surrogate for tRNA modiﬁcation.
After controlling for batch and tissue-speciﬁc eﬀects, my
best model was able to explain 41% of the training set
variance and 20% of the test set variance (position 14734).
Tissue-speciﬁc gene expression was correlated with the
response, and the two signals were diﬃcult to untangle
(compare linearity of ﬁgure 3A and 3B). Therefore, I tested
models trained on a single tissue type (ﬁgure 3C & 3D).
However, after running a training set size analysis (ﬁgure 4),
I noticed that there were not enough samples to make
accurate predictions.

Besides prediction, the various models resulted in over
200 genes of interest. To reduce this list I ran precondi-
tioned lasso, which is a two part method involving super-
vised principal components analysis followed by lasso. Pre-
conditioning lasso resulted in a model with only four genes

of interest: ALKBH8, MAD2L1BP, C1orf103, and TRMT5.
Not much is known about MAD2L1BP or C1orf103. How-
ever, ALKBH8 is a known tRNA modiﬁer, with homologs
that are associated with mitochondria, and TRMT5 is
tRNA methyltransferase with mitochondrial activity. It
would be interesting to follow up with functional studies
conducted on both of these genes.

I have some doubts as to the eﬀectiveness of some of
the tools I used in my pipeline for generating the feature
matrix and response variable (ﬂux capacitor has received
signiﬁcant criticism as of late). My ﬁrst step would be
to re-run it. Secondly, I would prefer to look at a RNA
sequencing data from the same tissues so that there is not
so much tissue-speciﬁc noise. Finally, validating genes of
interest (ALKBH8 and TRMT5) would be an extremely im-
portant future step. One possibility would be to perform a
knockout (eliminate gene expression of target gene) of these
genes in human cell lines, then sequence the mitochondria
to observe any changes in tRNA modiﬁcation.
