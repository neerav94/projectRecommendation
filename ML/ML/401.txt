Many organizations prospect for loyal 

supporters and donors by sending direct mail

The raw dataset, with 16 mixed (categorical

We tried the following approaches to 
classify mailings into two classes, namely 
donors who are likely to donate and those 
who are not: Multivariate Regression, SVM, 
Decision Tree, Neural Network, and 
Random Forest. Training errors , test errors, 
false positive error rates, false negative error

We noticed that test errors for most models 
are relatively high, with MVR and Random 
Forest models having high variance 
problems, and SVM having high bias 
problems. False positive errors are high for 
most models, with Neural Net model having 
the least false positive error. We want to 
minimize false positive error so as to save 
costs for campaign companies.  
 
Algorithm Selection 
 
From the previous initial fitting with 
different algorithms, we found that the 
dataset is a little messy and irregular in 
terms of patterns – there are some random 
processes in which a prospect would end up 
donating money or not. It is a character of 
this dataset, while it is not uncommon in real 
world datasets.  
When datasets have this degree of 
randomness, it is hard to lower the overall 
error ratio, however, we can still distinguish 
false positive and false negative, and 
specifically lower the error type that yields 
better profit, saves more efforts, etc.

Thus, we use -0.14 as threshold and 8 layers 
of hidden nets for our structural model. 
 

2)  Determine the optimal 

regularization under the 
structural model chosen 

This step we choose the optimal 
regularization (weight decay for parameters 
0, 0.1, … , 1) for the structural model found 
above by averaging our estimators of the 
overall misclassification error on the test set. 
We calculate the average with over 10 runs 
with different starting values. From this 
tuning process we found that decay 
parameter 0.5 yields the lowest overall 
misclassification. 
 

whatever makes more sense. In this case, we 
want to lower false positive error. It is 
because when a prospect is mistakenly 
considered “will donate”, then time and 
money resources would be spent and 
wasted. 
We choose to use Neural Network for this 
experiment, since it has the lowest false 
positive rate. There are three steps – first 
choose the number of neural nets and the 
threshold for the structural model, then 
choose the optimal regularization parameter 
under this optimized structural model, and 
lastly choose the threshold for false positive 
minimization. 
 
 

1)  Pick the number of neural nets 
and threshold for the structural 
model 

We did a looping experiment with 10 nets, 
with 20 threshold values ranging from -0.2 
to 0.2. For each value pair we calculate an 
overall estimation of misclassification, and 
get a 20 × 10 matrix. Applying averages to 
rows and columns, we choose the lowest 
average in both column and row to be the 
number of nets and threshold value. The 
result of applying average is as below:

We noticed that test errors for most models 
are relatively high, with MVR and Random 
Forest models having high variance 
problems, and SVM having high bias 
problems. False positive errors are high for 
most models, with Neural Net model having 
the least false positive error. We want to 
minimize false positive error so as to save 
costs for campaign companies.  
 
Algorithm Selection 
 
From the previous initial fitting with 
different algorithms, we found that the 
dataset is a little messy and irregular in 
terms of patterns – there are some random 
processes in which a prospect would end up 
donating money or not. It is a character of 
this dataset, while it is not uncommon in real 
world datasets.  
When datasets have this degree of 
randomness, it is hard to lower the overall 
error ratio, however, we can still distinguish 
false positive and false negative, and 
specifically lower the error type that yields 
better profit, saves more efforts, etc. 

distribution with respect to result. 
 
 
Training set and Test set Selection 

We created a training set by randomly 
selected 300 observations from the original 
dataset, and 100 observations as the test set. 
And replaced categorical variables with 
numbers.

Thus, we use -0.14 as threshold and 8 layers 
of hidden nets for our structural model. 
 

2)  Determine the optimal 

regularization under the 
structural model chosen 

This step we choose the optimal 
regularization (weight decay for parameters 
0, 0.1, … , 1) for the structural model found 
above by averaging our estimators of the 
overall misclassification error on the test set. 
We calculate the average with over 10 runs 
with different starting values. From this 
tuning process we found that decay 
parameter 0.5 yields the lowest overall 
misclassification. 
 

whatever makes more sense. In this case, we 
want to lower false positive error. It is 
because when a prospect is mistakenly 
considered “will donate”, then time and 
money resources would be spent and 
wasted. 
We choose to use Neural Network for this 
experiment, since it has the lowest false 
positive rate. There are three steps – first 
choose the number of neural nets and the 
threshold for the structural model, then 
choose the optimal regularization parameter 
under this optimized structural model, and 
lastly choose the threshold for false positive 
minimization. 
 
 

1)  Pick the number of neural nets 
and threshold for the structural 
model 

We did a looping experiment with 10 nets, 
with 20 threshold values ranging from -0.2 
to 0.2. For each value pair we calculate an 
overall estimation of misclassification, and 
get a 20 × 10 matrix. Applying averages to 
rows and columns, we choose the lowest 
average in both column and row to be the 
number of nets and threshold value. The 
result of applying average is as below:

3)  Determine threshold to minimize 

false positive misclassifications 

A way to control the false positive 
misclassified donors to be less is to choose a 
threshold of being a donor or non-donor. 

categories – positive, false negative, false 
positive, negative. When threshold is -0.3, 
every prospect is classified as non-donators, 
thus the false positive error is 0. When the 
threshold increases, false positive errors

increase while false negative error decrease. 
 
The question now is to find a balanced point 
of two types of errors so that the overall 
campaign is cost effective. We use the 
following formula:

When there is a higher “bar” for classifying  
prospects to be a donor, we filter the 
prospects with most certainty of being a 
donor. 
We tried 16 different threshold values and 
drew the result chart with four different 
 
𝑵𝒆𝒕 𝑪𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅 ($) = 𝑫𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 ($) ∗ 𝑫𝒐𝒏𝒐𝒓𝒔 (𝑴) − 𝑷𝒂𝒄𝒌𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑪𝒐𝒔𝒕 ($) ∗ 𝑷𝒂𝒄𝒌𝒂𝒈𝒆𝒔 (𝑵)  
 
Where Donation ($) and 
Package Cost($) are 
assumptions, Donors (M) 
corresponds to the number of 
positive occurrences, and 
Packages Sent (N) 
corresponds to the sum of 
positive and false-positive 
occurrences since the model 
predicts those prospects will 
donate. When we use the 
assumptions Donation = $50 
and Package Cost = $20, we 
observe the following Net 
Collected amount trend in 
chart on the right. 
Thus, the most cost-effective 
threshold is r=-0.1, with 
false-positive rate 18%.
