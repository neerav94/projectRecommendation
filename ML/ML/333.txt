1. INTRODUCTION 
The regulation of air pollutant levels is rapidly becoming one of the most important tasks for the 
governments of developing countries, especially China. Among the pollutant index,  Fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) is a significant one because it is a big concern to people's health when 
its level in the air is relatively high. PM2.5 refers to tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility 
and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated.  
However, the relationships between the concentration of these particles and meteorological and 
traffic factors are poorly understood. To shed some light on these connections, some of these 
advanced techniques have been introduced into air quality research. These studies utilized 
selected techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)  and Neural Network,  to predict 
ambient air pollutant levels based on mostly weather and sometimes traffic variables. 
This project attempted to apply some machine learning techniques to predict PM2.5 levels based 
on a dataset consisting of daily weather and traffic parameters in Beijing, China. Due to the 
uncertainty of the specific number PM2.5 level, I simplified the problem to be a binary 
classification one, that is to classify the PM2.5 level into "High" (> 115 ug/m3) and "low" (<= 
115 ug/m3).  The value is chosen based on the Air Quality Level standard in China, which set 115 
ug/m3 to be mild level pollution. 

2. DATA OVERVIEW 
In order to identify and forecast key parameters affecting air quality and propose appropriate 
preventive strategies and policies, it is essential to systematically collect data characterizing air 
quality.  
The data includes two parts: training data set and test data set. Training data set has 322 
observation points and the test data has 55 points. Each point represents the meteorological and 
traffic condition of a specific day in Beijing City. The total data set covers 47 days in 2014 and 
330 days in 2013.  
The data comes from China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System, Beijing Transportation 
Research Center and US Embassy in Beijing.  
As mentioned before, the output data was labeled as one or zero. One refers to high pollution 
level and zero refers to low pollution level. The total number labeled as zero is 103, while the 
remaining 274 points are labeled as 0.

3. FEATURE SELECTION 
A variety of meteorological, traffic and industrial parameters affect the air pollution level. After 
taking consideration of the data availability and importance, this project used the following five 
features:  
X1 - Temperature 
Temperature affect air quality because of temperate inversion: the warm air above cooler air acts 
like a lid, suppressing vertical mixing and trapping the cooler air at the surface. As pollutants 
from vehicles, fireplaces, and industry are emitted into the air, the inversion traps these pollutants 
near the ground. 
X2 - Wind speed 
Wind speed plays a big role in diluting pollutants. Generally, strong winds disperse pollutants, 
whereas light winds generally result in stagnant conditions allowing pollutants to build up over 
an area. 
X3 - Relative Humidity 
Humidity could affect the diffusion of contaminant. 
X4 - Traffic index 
The large number of cars on the road cause high level of air pollution and traffic jam may 
increase the pollutants concentration from vehicles. The definition of traffic index is a index 
reflecting the smooth status of traffic. The index range is from 0 to 10. 0 represents smooth and 
10 represents sever traffic jam. 
X5 - Air quality of previous day 
The air pollution level is influenced by the condition of the previous day to some extent. If the 
air pollution level of the previous day is high, the pollutants may stay and affect the following 
day. 

4. METHOD 
This prediction is a binary classification problem, so the following three supervised learning 
algorithms were used: 
1) Logistic regression: fitglm 
The output is a Generalized Linear Model. For this model, the prediction value is range for 0 to 
1. In order to get the label, the values were converted to zero (if 0 ≤ value ≤ 0.5) and one (if 
value ≥ 0.5). 
2) Naive Bayes Classification: fitcnb 
The output is a Classification Naive Bayes classifier. 
3) Support Vector Machines: fitcsvm

with data size, however GLM and SVM have large test error change with data size. Further 
more, the test error for SVM has the decline trend if the data size increases further. 

2) Prediction performance analysis 
Classification-based predictions for test examples can be evaluated using a variety of measures. 
The most straightforward measure is accuracy, which is the percentage of the examples that are 
correctly predicted. However, this measure may not be sufficient. This projected chose the 
measures in Table 1, since they are well understood and have been used extensively in areas such 
as information retrieval and computational biology, where prediction is a common task.

better to try other SVM models rather than the one from Matlab.

Furthermore, beside the meteorological and traffic factors, industrial parameters such as power 
plant emissions also play significant roles in air pollution. This project did use these features 
because they are not public available in China. In order to get better prediction results, the data 
should include more industrial condition features if possible.
