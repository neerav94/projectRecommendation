Abstract

Accelerometer and gyrometer data were collected from 3 construction work-
ers during regular work days in order to distinguish between diﬀerent ac-
tivities. These activities - hammering, sawing, sweeping and drilling - were
collected with a smart watch attached to the worker’s dominant hand, with
a sampling rate of 25Hz. The dataset was divided into training and test set
with two diﬀerent partitions - 50/50 and 80/20 (training/test). A prepro-
cessing stage was ﬁrst performed in order to minimize three main sources of
problems - noise, gravity inﬂuence, and outliers. Then, 46 features, includ-
ing time and frequency domain, were extracted from a window of 40 samples
(1.6 seconds). Five diﬀerent algorithms were tested in order to verify their
performances. The tests were conducted using the two diﬀerent partitions
of training and testing. A feature selection algorithm was performed in
order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and evaluate the
models performance. Finally, a last test was conducted by comparing the
performance of each algorithm using both sensors’ data and using only ac-
celerometr data. The best performance measured by the number of correctly
classiﬁed activities was 91%.

construction workers. By being able to better quantify direct work - job
hours spent doing activities related to work - and indirect work - activities
not related to work (e.g. waiting and preparing material), general contrac-
tors can bid projects with more conﬁdence, increase their proﬁt margin, ﬁnd
bottlenecks on workﬂow and so on. In this paper, a ﬁrst step was taken to-
wards the goal of increasing and understanding productivity in construction
sites. We evaluate diﬀerent machine learning algorithms that aim to classify
construction activities such as hammering, sawing, sweeping, and drilling
based on accelerometer and gyrometer data.

2. Previous Work

There has been a large variety of works trying to identify user activities
based on accelerometers and gyrometers. A high number of papers are fo-
cused on ﬁtness by classifying activities such as walking, running, cycling
etc. Some examples are found in [1] and [2]. However, in a much smaller
number, papers focused in diﬀerent applications can also be found. In [3],
accelerometer data is used to identify posture orientation, periods of activ-
ity and rest and when important events happen with patients such as fall.
[4] uses accelerometer data to identify user traits such as sex, height, and
weight. In [5], accelerometers are used to identify anomalies in an helicopter
transmission system. This adds a new layer of information that is crucial
for making sure the system is in good conditions. In [6], accelerometer and
microphone data are used to track the progress of maintenance or assembly
tasks in a workshop. In [7], a wiimote is used to detect a dictionary of 18 ba-
sic hand gestures. In addition to the referenced works, commercial systems
are available, with open APIs, where users can develop applications on top
of the classiﬁers. However, they are limited in the number of activities it
can recognize. The lack of research in applying machine learning techniques
to construction environments motivated this work.

3. Data Set and Preprocessing

Data from a 3D accelerometer and 3D gyrometer was collected using the
GearLive smart watch from Samsung with sampling rate of 25Hz. Previ-
ous research has shown that frequencies between 20-100Hz are enough to
capture human movements [8]. An app running on the watch (and phone)
was developed in order to collect data and send it to a paired phone via
Bluetooth. The app running on the phone was responsible to send the data

to a webserver where it could be accessed. The data was collected from
3 subjects in three diﬀerent days and labeled during each activity. This
data set comprises of approximately 55 daily repetitions of each movement
done by each subject. This provided us with a total of approximately 500
repetitions of each movement.

After collecting the data, signal processing techniques were performed in
order to minimize noise, gravity inﬂuence and outliers. Thus, two diﬀerent
type of ﬁlters were used. First a third order Butterworth with cutoﬀ of 10Hz
was used to remove high frequency noise and then a third order elliptic ﬁlter
with an edge frequency of 0.3Hz was used to remove gravity’s inﬂuence [9].

4. Feature Extraction and Feature Selection

Raw data coming from accelerometers and gyrometers very rarely can be
used directly. Thus, after a preprocessing step, features were extracted from
the raw data within a time frame, in order to characterize user’s physical
activity.
In [9], a survey of the most common activities used in context-
recognition is presented.

For this work, a total of 46 features (time and frequency domain) were
extracted with a 50% overlap window of 40 samples. Among this 46 fea-
tures, 26 were related to accelerometer and 20 to gyrometer. Common
time-domain based metrics such as mean, variance, percentiles, max, min,
correlation coeﬃcients, rotation angle, and signal magnitude area were ex-
tracted, partially from each of the three axes, partially from the magnitude.
Frequency domain features such as spectral energy and entropy was com-
puted for both, magnitude and axes.

A feature selection algorithm [2] was used in order to evaluate the po-
tential of reducing the dimensionality of the feature set with respect to
the model’s accuracy. This algorithm performs a forward-backward search
where it alternately adds features to the feature vector with the current
best quality and remove features based on a minimal threshold gain (thus
examining subsets of combinations that have not been considered before).
A map showing the four diﬀerent classes and all features is shown in ﬁgure

Five diﬀerent algorithms were used in order to compare their perfor-
mances - Naive Bayes (NB), Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Multi

Activity Recognition in Construction Sites Using 3D

Accelerometer and Gyrometer

Gustavo Cezar

CS229 - Final Report

Abstract

Accelerometer and gyrometer data were collected from 3 construction work-
ers during regular work days in order to distinguish between diﬀerent ac-
tivities. These activities - hammering, sawing, sweeping and drilling - were
collected with a smart watch attached to the worker’s dominant hand, with
a sampling rate of 25Hz. The dataset was divided into training and test set
with two diﬀerent partitions - 50/50 and 80/20 (training/test). A prepro-
cessing stage was ﬁrst performed in order to minimize three main sources of
problems - noise, gravity inﬂuence, and outliers. Then, 46 features, includ-
ing time and frequency domain, were extracted from a window of 40 samples
(1.6 seconds). Five diﬀerent algorithms were tested in order to verify their
performances. The tests were conducted using the two diﬀerent partitions
of training and testing. A feature selection algorithm was performed in
order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and evaluate the
models performance. Finally, a last test was conducted by comparing the
performance of each algorithm using both sensors’ data and using only ac-
celerometr data. The best performance measured by the number of correctly
classiﬁed activities was 91%.

1. Introduction

We have seen in the last few years a signiﬁcant increase in the wearables
industry. Many new devices are coming to market every year. And the main
reason is because the price of sensors such as accelerometers and gyrome-
ters are getting cheaper every year due to the smart phone industry push.
Therefore, the possibility of collecting continuous data and perform further
analysis can be a powerful tool in many diﬀerent applications. Nowadays
we are seeing many applications of wearable devices in ﬁtness and health
industry. However, no application was found by the author, until this date,

where wearable devices are being used to classify work-related activities of
construction workers. By being able to better quantify direct work - job
hours spent doing activities related to work - and indirect work - activities
not related to work (e.g. waiting and preparing material), general contrac-
tors can bid projects with more conﬁdence, increase their proﬁt margin, ﬁnd
bottlenecks on workﬂow and so on. In this paper, a ﬁrst step was taken to-
wards the goal of increasing and understanding productivity in construction
sites. We evaluate diﬀerent machine learning algorithms that aim to classify
construction activities such as hammering, sawing, sweeping, and drilling
based on accelerometer and gyrometer data.

2. Previous Work

There has been a large variety of works trying to identify user activities
based on accelerometers and gyrometers. A high number of papers are fo-
cused on ﬁtness by classifying activities such as walking, running, cycling
etc. Some examples are found in [1] and [2]. However, in a much smaller
number, papers focused in diﬀerent applications can also be found. In [3],
accelerometer data is used to identify posture orientation, periods of activ-
ity and rest and when important events happen with patients such as fall.
[4] uses accelerometer data to identify user traits such as sex, height, and
weight. In [5], accelerometers are used to identify anomalies in an helicopter
transmission system. This adds a new layer of information that is crucial
for making sure the system is in good conditions. In [6], accelerometer and
microphone data are used to track the progress of maintenance or assembly
tasks in a workshop. In [7], a wiimote is used to detect a dictionary of 18 ba-
sic hand gestures. In addition to the referenced works, commercial systems
are available, with open APIs, where users can develop applications on top
of the classiﬁers. However, they are limited in the number of activities it
can recognize. The lack of research in applying machine learning techniques
to construction environments motivated this work.

3. Data Set and Preprocessing

Data from a 3D accelerometer and 3D gyrometer was collected using the
GearLive smart watch from Samsung with sampling rate of 25Hz. Previ-
ous research has shown that frequencies between 20-100Hz are enough to
capture human movements [8]. An app running on the watch (and phone)
was developed in order to collect data and send it to a paired phone via
Bluetooth. The app running on the phone was responsible to send the data

2

to a webserver where it could be accessed. The data was collected from
3 subjects in three diﬀerent days and labeled during each activity. This
data set comprises of approximately 55 daily repetitions of each movement
done by each subject. This provided us with a total of approximately 500
repetitions of each movement.

After collecting the data, signal processing techniques were performed in
order to minimize noise, gravity inﬂuence and outliers. Thus, two diﬀerent
type of ﬁlters were used. First a third order Butterworth with cutoﬀ of 10Hz
was used to remove high frequency noise and then a third order elliptic ﬁlter
with an edge frequency of 0.3Hz was used to remove gravity’s inﬂuence [9].

4. Feature Extraction and Feature Selection

Raw data coming from accelerometers and gyrometers very rarely can be
used directly. Thus, after a preprocessing step, features were extracted from
the raw data within a time frame, in order to characterize user’s physical
activity.
In [9], a survey of the most common activities used in context-
recognition is presented.

For this work, a total of 46 features (time and frequency domain) were
extracted with a 50% overlap window of 40 samples. Among this 46 fea-
tures, 26 were related to accelerometer and 20 to gyrometer. Common
time-domain based metrics such as mean, variance, percentiles, max, min,
correlation coeﬃcients, rotation angle, and signal magnitude area were ex-
tracted, partially from each of the three axes, partially from the magnitude.
Frequency domain features such as spectral energy and entropy was com-
puted for both, magnitude and axes.

A feature selection algorithm [2] was used in order to evaluate the po-
tential of reducing the dimensionality of the feature set with respect to
the model’s accuracy. This algorithm performs a forward-backward search
where it alternately adds features to the feature vector with the current
best quality and remove features based on a minimal threshold gain (thus
examining subsets of combinations that have not been considered before).
A map showing the four diﬀerent classes and all features is shown in ﬁgure

5. Results

Five diﬀerent algorithms were used in order to compare their perfor-
mances - Naive Bayes (NB), Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), Multi
Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),

and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). For each algorithm, two dif-
ferent partitions between training and test data were performed (50/50 and
80/20). Within each partition, accelerometer-only and accelerometer and
gyrometer data were used in order to evaluate the eﬀect of the gyrometer
sensor with the accuracy of the diﬀerent models. Subsets of the feature set
were also evaluated.
