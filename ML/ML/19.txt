1. Abstract 

 

We propose and implement a way of estimating 

distance from Wi-Fi access points as a method of indoor 
localization. In contrast to many other solutions, the 
proposed method is software-only and works with current 
widespread technology, and can be implemented on 
current smartphones without silicon modifications. Our 
method utilizes machine learning to produce a relatively 
low root mean squared error of 1.27 meters, training on 
data collected between 2m and 15m away from the 
wireless AP.  

2. Introduction 

GPS is widely accepted as a standard of effective and 

accurate positioning. However, GPS requires signal 
acquisition from multiple satellites, a complication 
anywhere inside structures or underground. As our need 
for navigation systems grow, accurate indoor localization 
becomes increasingly valuable and necessary. 

We propose an infrastructure-free method of 

triangulating local position in 3D space through predicting 
direct-path distances to multiple Wi-Fi access points. We 
differentiate our system from other localization 
methodologies by its straightforwardness and 
generalizability, while still attaining a fairly accurate 
result. Our system uses metrics that are exposed by Wi-Fi 
chipsets as part of normal operation and do not require any 
hardware changes, nor changes in router-software. Our 
technique readily works with 2.4GHz 802.11n routers.

3.1. Intricacies of Wi-Fi localization 

Wi-Fi transmits using Orthogonal Frequency 

Division Multiplexing (OFDM), meaning that it 
broadcasts on several narrowly separated subcarriers at the 
same time to increase data rate. Each subcarrier is 
synchronized at the beginning of a frame, thus the phase 
angle between the subcarriers encodes time of flight data 
for this packet. Furthermore, each subcarrier is measured 
with an additional phase angle on each antenna due to the 
spatial layout of the antenna array. At the receiver, the 

 

client can recombine the various signal characteristics 
from multiple antennas and gain information about the 
channel. The end result is a complex number describing 
the signal received per antenna per subcarrier. 
Collectively, this data is known as Channel State 
Information (CSI). We will analyze further our data 
format in section 4.2. 

 
Radio signals in the gigahertz range are prone to 

reflecting off of walls and other surfaces. This introduces 
complications to our estimation of the direct-path by 
creating a multi-path system. Due to the effect of multi-
path interference, as well as normal signal attenuation, the 
received signal will be a convolution of the original signal 
with the wireless channel’s properties. See Figure 1.

1. Abstract 

 

We propose and implement a way of estimating 

distance from Wi-Fi access points as a method of indoor 
localization. In contrast to many other solutions, the 
proposed method is software-only and works with current 
widespread technology, and can be implemented on 
current smartphones without silicon modifications. Our 
method utilizes machine learning to produce a relatively 
low root mean squared error of 1.27 meters, training on 
data collected between 2m and 15m away from the 
wireless AP.  

2. Introduction 

GPS is widely accepted as a standard of effective and 

accurate positioning. However, GPS requires signal 
acquisition from multiple satellites, a complication 
anywhere inside structures or underground. As our need 
for navigation systems grow, accurate indoor localization 
becomes increasingly valuable and necessary. 

We propose an infrastructure-free method of 

triangulating local position in 3D space through predicting 
direct-path distances to multiple Wi-Fi access points. We 
differentiate our system from other localization 
methodologies by its straightforwardness and 
generalizability, while still attaining a fairly accurate 
result. Our system uses metrics that are exposed by Wi-Fi 
chipsets as part of normal operation and do not require any 
hardware changes, nor changes in router-software. Our 
technique readily works with 2.4GHz 802.11n routers.

Having proven that the distance estimation works

distances up to 15m. In this range we collected about 1 
million packets, enough to generate at least 104 samples

verifying the limited effects, we reduced the training set

1. Abstract 

 

We propose and implement a way of estimating 

distance from Wi-Fi access points as a method of indoor 
localization. In contrast to many other solutions, the 
proposed method is software-only and works with current 
widespread technology, and can be implemented on 
current smartphones without silicon modifications. Our 
method utilizes machine learning to produce a relatively 
low root mean squared error of 1.27 meters, training on 
data collected between 2m and 15m away from the 
wireless AP.  

2. Introduction 

GPS is widely accepted as a standard of effective and 

accurate positioning. However, GPS requires signal 
acquisition from multiple satellites, a complication 
anywhere inside structures or underground. As our need 
for navigation systems grow, accurate indoor localization 
becomes increasingly valuable and necessary. 

We propose an infrastructure-free method of 

triangulating local position in 3D space through predicting 
direct-path distances to multiple Wi-Fi access points. We 
differentiate our system from other localization 
methodologies by its straightforwardness and 
generalizability, while still attaining a fairly accurate 
result. Our system uses metrics that are exposed by Wi-Fi 
chipsets as part of normal operation and do not require any 
hardware changes, nor changes in router-software. Our 
technique readily works with 2.4GHz 802.11n routers. 
 

3. Background Information 

3.1. Intricacies of Wi-Fi localization 

Wi-Fi transmits using Orthogonal Frequency 

Division Multiplexing (OFDM), meaning that it 
broadcasts on several narrowly separated subcarriers at the 
same time to increase data rate. Each subcarrier is 
synchronized at the beginning of a frame, thus the phase 
angle between the subcarriers encodes time of flight data 
for this packet. Furthermore, each subcarrier is measured 
with an additional phase angle on each antenna due to the 
spatial layout of the antenna array. At the receiver, the 

 

client can recombine the various signal characteristics 
from multiple antennas and gain information about the 
channel. The end result is a complex number describing 
the signal received per antenna per subcarrier. 
Collectively, this data is known as Channel State 
Information (CSI). We will analyze further our data 
format in section 4.2. 

 
Radio signals in the gigahertz range are prone to 

reflecting off of walls and other surfaces. This introduces 
complications to our estimation of the direct-path by 
creating a multi-path system. Due to the effect of multi-
path interference, as well as normal signal attenuation, the 
received signal will be a convolution of the original signal 
with the wireless channel’s properties. See Figure 1. 

Figure 1 Multipath and Signal Propagation, shown with one 
transmitter TX and two antennas RX1,2. Sometimes a signal 
could even destructively interfere on RX1, but can be 
reconstructed through RX2.1 

 

The 802.11n Wi-Fi specification transmits in the 

2.4GHz ISM band, using 11 overlapping channels in the 
US and up to 14 elsewhere in the world. Each channel 
defines 64 subcarrier frequencies, each separated by 
302.5kHz. Through complex signal processing on the CSI, 
it is possible to obtain a vector of possible AoAs (Angles 
of Attack) and isolate the direct path (the Euclidean line to 
the router)2.  

 
The signal processing can be summarized as this: the 

phase angle between subcarriers encodes Time of Flight 
(ToF), and the phase angle between antennas encodes 
AoA. By obtaining AoA and ToF of the direct path, one

6.3. Gamma experimentation 

We observed the effect of Gamma value (for the 
RBF Kernel) on the cross validation error. Mechanically 
altering it to larger values and testing the same feature 
vector as defined in Section 6.1, we observed decreasing 
accuracy as we increased gamma. See Figure 4 for more 
details. 
 

Figure 4. Gamma vs 5-folds root mean squared error. 

Ultimately, we left the gamma value unchanged 

from the mathematical definition in Section 5, as that 
yielded the smallest RMS error (approximately 0.001 in 
Figure 4). 
 

6.4. Pairwise Multiplications 

From further analysis of the mathematics of 
calculating Time of Flight from received signals, we 
determined that some sort of convolution might be 
necessary. Intuitively, AoA and ToF are calculated using 
matrix multiplication from CSI. 

 
Since AoA is calculated through combinations of 
phase and magnitude between antennas and ToF through 
combinations per channel, it seemed to be a reasonable 
choice for us to find all pair combinations of features and 
multiply the pair together. The algorithm should figure out 
which of these pairs contributed the most to the distance 
estimation.  
 

Therefore, we focused on a smaller number of 
packets for runtime consideration, and generated our 
feature space using the outer product of the CSI vector. 
Using two concatenated packets, 65K features were 
generated, with up to 260K features for 4 packets. 
Essentially, we are learning on a single fully connected 
neural net layer.  
 

This technique yielded substantially improved 

results. With a relatively small 1.27m of RMS error, the 2-
packet vector gave the best generalization of actual 

 

 

 

distance. After achieving a substantially better result for 
the 2-packet vector, we attempted 3 and 4 packet 
groupings with a vastly higher number of features, but the 
test error increased. We attribute this effect to overfitting. 

 
With infinite training time, we would have tried to 

further train with triplet-wise multiplications 
(multiplications of 3 numbers chosen from the feature 
vector), on feature vectors of 2 to 10 packets. However, 
performing triplet-wise multiplication on a two packet 
feature vector would generate 7 million features would not 
be feasible due to memory and processing constraints. 
However, it is highly possible to attain high accuracy with 
those features as the convolution style of data modeling 
makes perfect sense in this application. 

6.5. Internal Pairwise Multiplications 

Based on a theory that each packet might be 

linearly separable we sought to limit our feature vector by 
convolving each individual packet, instead of the entire 
multi-packet vector. This allowed us to train on larger 
concatenated packet counts with acceptable runtime. 
 

Using 1-packet, 4-packets, and 10-packets, we could 
not improve RMS error; results were substantially worse 
than the current optimum of 1.27m. We obtained RMS 
errors of 2.1, 2.1, and 2.5m respectively. 
 
7. Future Considerations 

Using 2-packet convolutions and a Kernel Ridge 

Regression, we have achieved almost meter-level accuracy 
on a tough localization challenge. With no signal 
processing involved, we demonstrate errors that compare 
favorably against much more complex and advanced 
localization research. There is promise in applying 
machine learning to localization and Machine Learning 
could be coupled with more theoretical algorithms for 
improved results. 

 

Due to our final algorithm’s resemblance to 

 
neural net structures, future research should evaluate the 
use of deeper neural nets to approximate distance. One 
possible way to increase speed would be restricting the 
pair-wise multiplication to just phases or just magnitudes, 
since the phase and magnitude product makes little sense.  
 

However, given current results and our initial 
constraints to commodity hardware, indoor localization 
appears increasingly ready for large-scale deployment.
