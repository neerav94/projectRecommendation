Abstract

We used multinomial logistic regression and support vector machines to predict the number of
touchdowns a quarterback will throw in an upcoming game. Our best model correctly predicted
a quarterbacks passing touchdowns 38.6% of the time with a mean square error of 1.58. This
compares favorably to ESPN’s forecasts, which in 2014 correctly predicted a quarterback’s
passing touchdowns 33% of the time with a mean squared error of 1.39.

Introduction

1.
Fantasy sports is a broad genre of games in which participants act as owners, assembling teams of
players to compete against other fantasy owners based on the measured individual performance
of real players. Fantasy football is the most popular version of this game among Americans.
Close to 33 million people participated in fantasy football leagues last year, spending around
$800 million on fantasy media products. In fantasy football, participants compete head to head
by selecting NFL players to ﬁll a lineup for a given week. At the conclusion of each game,
each player’s performance is translated into points by a predetermined formula. For example,
quarterbacks get 4 points for touchdowns and .04 points per passing yard. The fantasy player
with the most points after the conclusion of a week wins the matchup.

In this project, we used machine learning to predict the number of passing touchdowns a
quarterback will throw in an upcoming game. To accomplish this we used multinomial logistic
regression and support vector machines. Forward selection was used to choose a set of predictive
features from approximately 25 features related to a quarterback’s passing touchdowns. Our
models were evaluated based on their correct prediction rates and the mean squared error of
the predictions. We found that the prediction accuracy of our best models compared favorably
to ESPN’s predictions.

2. Data and Preprocessing
Detailed NFL data is available from several data providers, but often at high cost. Fortunately,
the website www.pro-football-reference.com has a relatively complete collection of NFL data
available at no charge.
In order to avoid violating their terms of service, which explicitly
prohibit automated scraping, we manually downloaded data from the 2008 through the 2013
NFL seasons. After formatting, our data consisted of two tables - one containing team speciﬁc
data and the other containing player speciﬁc data. The team data includes 52 features that

NFL seasons. After formatting, our data consisted of two tables - one containing team speciﬁc
data and the other containing player speciﬁc data. The team data includes 52 features that

correspond to what a particular team did in a particular game. For example, this data includes
features such as the total rushing and passing yards a team’s oﬀense accumulated. The player
data includes 65 features that represent a player’s performance in a particular game. This
includes variables such as touchdowns and passing yards, as well as more detailed information
such as where receivers were targeted on the ﬁeld. In total, our data consists of 3,200 team
performances and 30,000 player performances.

3. Models and Features
We approached our classiﬁcation problem with both multinomial logistic regression and support
vector machine models. For both types of models, our features consisted of rolling averages of:
statistics speciﬁc to the quarterback, statistics speciﬁc to the quarterback’s oﬀense, and statistics
speciﬁc to the opposing defense. Statistics speciﬁc to the quarterback include passing yards,
passing touchdowns, interceptions, pass completions and pass attempts. Statistics speciﬁc to
the quarterback’s oﬀense include turnovers, rushing yards, total yards, sacks, and points scored.
Statistics speciﬁc to the opposing defense include total yards allowed, points allowed, sacks, and
passing yards allowed. We decided to use a rolling average of these relevant statistics because
each of them can vary greatly from one game to the next. We evaluated our models based on
the proportion of quarterback passing touchdowns correctly predicted and the mean squared
error of our predictions, both of which were estimated using using k-fold cross validation (with
k ≥ 25). Features were selected using forward selection for multinomial logistic regression and
backward selection for support vector machines. For both the forward and backward selection
we attempted to optimize the proportion of correct predictions.

4. Results and Discussion
Our support vector machine models and multinomial logistic regression models predicted pass-
ing touchdowns with similar accuracy. Multinomial logistic regression in general predicted more
touchdowns than SVM and produced predictions with smaller mean squared errors. We creat-
ing features for both models we varied the number of previous games used in rolling average
calculations. In the tables below, the number of games used to create the rolling averages is
represented by m.

4.1. Multinomial Logistic Regression
The results of our best logistic regression models for diﬀerent values of m can be seen in the
table below. Note that the best model as measured by proportion correct used only the most
recent game to make its prediction (m = 1).

The best set of features found by forward selection can be seen in Table 1. Notice that the
best feature set varies depends greatly on m. That said, it is also important to realize that many
of the statistics considered for selection are highly correlated. For example, the number of total
yards a defense allows is high correlated with the number of passing yards a defense allows.

As the ﬁrst Table 1 shows, the best multinomial logistic regression model (as measured by
proportion correct) coincided with m = 1 and was correct 38.6% of the time with a mean squared
error of 1.59. The confusion matrix for this model can be seen below. Note that this model

4.2. Support Vector Machines
In this section, we present our predictive results using a support vector machine (SVM) with a
linear kernel.1 As was done for the logistic regression, we tested our SVM using diﬀerent values
of m. Below, we list the features used within each iteration of the SVM, as chosen by backwards
feature selection: Just as logisitic regression, the feature selection for the SVM varies greatly

for each m. Note that for m = 5, backwards selection simply chooses all the available features.

The model is correct more than 50% of the time when it predicts zero touchdowns. However,
the model does extremely poorly for outcomes beyond one touchdown. In fact, it never predicts
a quarterback throwing more than two. While the logistic regression also fails to predict a high
number of touchdowns (say, three or more), it still predicts some two touchdown events, thus
outperforming the SVM here.

5. Conclusions
We used multinomial logistic regression and support vector machines to predict the number of
touchdowns a quarterback will throw in an upcoming week. Our best model correctly predicted
a quarterbacks passing touchdowns 38.6% of the time with a mean square error of 1.58. This
compares favorably to ESPN’s forecasts, which in 2014 correctly predicted a quarterback’s
passing touchdowns 33% of the time with a mean squared error of 1.39. That said, we are not
ready to conclude that our best model is superior to ESPN’s predictions because we have not
yet tested our models on the data from 2014.

6. Future Work
We would certainly like to further compare our best models to ESPN’s model. The most direct
way to do this is to gather data on 2014 and predict the outcome of these games using our models
trained on data from 2008 to 2013. The predictions of our models would be directly comprable
to those of ESPN. Moving forward, we also intend to apply techniques similar to those used in
this project to predict other discrete fantasy football statistics such as quarterback interceptions
and touchdowns by non-quarterbacks.
