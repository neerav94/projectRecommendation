Abstract 

This application derives the IDF (Intensity-Duration-Frequency) curve if the user put the historical 

rainfall data. Compare to the previous  methods, it applies the locally weighted linear regression, 

so it comes to be simpler than the previous methods. 

 

Introduction 

 

Because  of  the  climate  change  the  importance  of  water  management  is  regarded  more 

important  than  before.  For  example,  California  is  in  trouble  with  drought  and  Texas  got  a  huge 

damage from the flood. Therefore, to handle this problem, Hydrologist predict the abnormal flood 

or drought from the past rainfall data and design the hydraulic sturctures to prevent the natural 

disaster occur by the rainfall.   

By analyzing historic rainfall data, rainfall frequency can be derived and get the data such as 100 

year  frequency  rainfall  or  drought.  Hydrologists  derive  the  IDF(Intensity,  Duration,  Frequency) 

curve  each  time  period  analyzed  rainfall  data,  these  data  decrease  by  the  log  scale.  Nowadays, 

they use several methods to derive the IDF curve, and these methods needs to derive parameters 

for each region.   

This  application  analyzes  and  derives  the  rainfall  frequency  if  the  user  puts  the  historic  rainfall 

data. Moreover, this application derives the IDF curve by applying the linear regression algorithm, 

so it can be applied regardless of the region, without finding parameters for each region.

There are several empirical equation to derive rainfall intensity. Nowadays, to get more accurate 

rainfall intensity, following rainfall intensity formula is used. 

𝐼(𝑇, 𝑡) =  

𝑎 + 𝑏 + ln 𝑇/𝑡𝑛

𝑐 + 𝑑 × ln √𝑇/𝑡 + √𝑇

 

 

 I is the rainfall intensity, T is return period(year), t is duration(min).   

  a,  b,  c,  d  and  n are  the  parameters  that are  determined  by  region.  Other  empirical  equations 

also need the parameter for each region

Result & Discussion 

  To get the weights, 

 
By  the  result  of  the  above  from Suwon  city  data  the  𝜏  value  is  estimated  as  75,  and  it  is  also 

applicable for Icheon City rainfall data as shown as below. 

 

By applying the  𝜏  as derived, the above figures are the derived IDF curves of several frequencies, 

 

by that  𝜏  value.   

Previous methods need several parameters to derive the IDF curve and rainfall intensity for each 

region.  Moreover,  more  accurate  method  needs  more  complicate  and  more  various  parameters. 

However,  this  application  is  independent  from  these  parameters  so  it  is  applicable  at  various 

regions. Therefore, to derive the IDF by this application, only historical rainfall data is needed.       

 

Future Work 

The bandwidth parameter needs to be more accurate by comparing the results of other various 

regions  rainfall  data  to  be  more  applicable  for  various  regions.  Moreover,  it  is  extreme  climate 

regions such as desert, polar, tropical regions rainfall data is needed to compare and check that is 

applicable for those climates.
