Introduction 

Small  online  retailers  usually  set  themselves  apart  from  brick  and  mortar  stores,  traditional 

brand  names,  and  giant  online  retailers  by  offering  goods  at  exceptional  value.  In  addition  to 

price,  they  compete  for  shoppers’  attention  via  descriptive  listing  titles,  whose  effectiveness  as 

search keywords can help drive sales. In this study, machine learning techniques will be applied 

to online retail data to measure the link between keywords and sales volumes.

2.1  Data Description 

The  dataset  used  in  the  study  is  a  data  sample  of  500  dress  sale  listings  on  the  Ali  Express 

online platform, provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache and Lichman 2013). 

It contains sales numbers and 13 product attributes for the merchandise. The sales numbers are 

snapshots  taken  from  the  listing  in  fall  2013  and  represent  the  sold  volumes  in  the  6  months 

prior  to  the  snapshot  date.  The  product  attributes  include  style,  price,  shape,  and  design 

categories. Additionally, listing titles and descriptions are collected using a web crawler tool on 

the URLs provided. The texts are appended to the corresponding dress item.  

For  this  study,  a  binary  label  for the dataset  is created,  based  on the  average  sales  volume. 1 

denotes a popular item with high-volume sales, and 0 denotes otherwise. Selecting a threshold of 

200 for the average sales volume yields a 45/55 split between the hot-or-not sellers, i.e. an item 

that is sold on average at least once a day in the last 6 months is considered to be a high-sales 

item for a small online retailer. The modeling experiments for this binary classification problem 

discussed  in  the  later  section  are  meant  to  assess  the  effect  of  keywords  on  predicting  sales 

performance. 

2.2  Textual Feature Creation 

Words  are  parsed  from the  texts  downloaded  from  the  dress  webpages.  The  uses  of  the  words 

are  tallied  up  and  the  most  common  words  (e.g.  free  shipping,  fashion,  2013)  minus  the  stop 

words (e.g. the, a, and) constitute the bag of 180 words in this study (Ahn and Spangler 2014). 

Unlike  literature  and  news  articles,  sale  listing  title  and  descriptions  are  short  and  succinct  to 

capture shoppers’ attention span. How many times a word is used in a listing is not as relevant 

in  this  domain  as  what  words  are  used.  Thus,  a  textual  feature  is  created  for  each  word  as  a 

binary variable denoting the presence of the word in the listing.  

2.3  Feature Selection 

Correlation analysis is performed on the dataset to see  which words are highly correlated  with 

the  high-sales  item  listings  and  how  they  correlate  with  each  other  (Yu et al.  2012).  To  avoid 

collinearity,  words  that  convey  redundant  information  are  removed.  The  remaining  sales-

correlated words become candidate predictor variables for a model scenario later. 

Aikaike  information  criterion  (AIC)  is  also  used  to  perform  feature  selection.  It  provides  a 

systematic  way  of  selecting  features  that  minimizes  information  loss  by  balancing  the  tradeoff 

between  goodness  of  fit  and  model  complexity  (Kaya  and  Karsligil  2010).  It  serves  as  a 

regularization  technique  that  penalizes  models  with  poor  fit  and  models  with  too  many 

parameters.  Feature  sets  determined  from  forward  search,  backward  search,  and  bidirectional 

search using AIC respectively are examined for statistical significance using p-value. Statistically

2.4  Model Experiments 

There  are  6  scenarios  to  experiment  using  original  data  with:  I)  no  textual  features,  II)  all 

textual  features,  III)  correlated  textual  features,  IV)  textual  features  from  forward  search,  V) 

textual features from backward search, and VI) textual features from bidirectional search. The 

first  scenario  serves  as  a  baseline  for  comparison  with  additional  textual  information  on  sales 

prediction.  Data  is  pre-processed  for  the  10-fold  cross  validation  to  be  conducted  during  the 

model training and testing process. The dataset is randomly split, such that each run uses 90% 

for  training  and  10%  for  testing.  Logistic  regression  and  support  vector  machine  are  standard 

models  used  for  binary  classification  problems  and  are  explored  for  this  study  (Culotta  2012). 

The  multiple-model  approach  provides  additional  validation  of  the  effect  of  keywords  on  sales 

prediction.  

The  logistic  regression  model  fit  outputs  predicted  probabilities  of  the  samples  having  positive 

labels,  and  probability  of  50%  or  more  is considered  a  prediction  of  the  item as  being  popular 

and  having  high  sales.  The  SVM  model  classifies  samples  according  to  where  they  fall  with 

respect  to  the  support  vector  decision  boundary.  Initial  tests  show  that  SVM  models  trained 

with  the  common  Gaussian  kernel  are  overfitting  the  data  and  do  not  generalize  well.  After 

experimenting  with  different  kernels,  the  linear  kernel  delivers  the  most  reasonably  close  train 

and  test  errors  and  is  thus  chosen  for  the  SVM  model.  It  suggests  that  a  linear  decision 

boundary is appropriate for the set of e-commerce sales data used in this study.

Prediction  accuracy  and  sales  prediction  precision  are  the  metrics  used  to  evaluate  the 

effectiveness  of  the  features  and  models  in  identifying  the  high-sales  item  listings.  Prediction 

accuracy is calculated as the percentage of predictions being correct out of all predictions made. 

Sales prediction precision is calculated as the percentage of high-sales (i.e. positive) predictions 

being  correct  out  of  all  high-sales  (i.e.  positive)  predictions  made.  Prediction  accuracy  and 

precision of the holdout sets are respectively averaged from the 10 cross-validation runs for each

The  first  scenario  sets  up  the  baseline  metrics  for  other  scenarios  with  textual  features  to 

measure  up  against.  The  second  scenario  demonstrates  an  overfitting  situation,  in  which  all 

textual features are being thrown into the model. Including irrelevant features (i.e. nonessential 

words) into the model actually deteriorates the model’s ability to detect high-sales listings from 

those that are not.

The models  in scenarios III through  VI contain heuristically selected textual features and have 

been found to outperform the baseline scenario in almost all result categories. The performance 

lifts  in  prediction  accuracy  and  sales  prediction  precision  over  random  behavior  and  baseline 

scenario reinforce the notion that certain keywords can be effective indicators of popular online 

listings with high sales volumes.

In  this  study,  a  set  of  online  retail  sales  data  is  examined  to  assess  the  impact  of  listing 

keywords  on  predicting  sales  performance.  Textual  features  are  created  from  the  e-commerce 

dataset,  and  candidate  predictor  variables  are  selected  based  on  correlation  and  AIC  analyses.

The  multiple-model  approach  provides  additional  validation  of  the  effect  of  keywords  on  sales 

prediction.  

The  logistic  regression  model  fit  outputs  predicted  probabilities  of  the  samples  having  positive 

labels,  and  probability  of  50%  or  more  is considered  a  prediction  of  the  item as  being  popular 

and  having  high  sales.  The  SVM  model  classifies  samples  according  to  where  they  fall  with 

respect  to  the  support  vector  decision  boundary.  Initial  tests  show  that  SVM  models  trained 

with  the  common  Gaussian  kernel  are  overfitting  the  data  and  do  not  generalize  well.  After 

experimenting  with  different  kernels,  the  linear  kernel  delivers  the  most  reasonably  close  train 

and  test  errors  and  is  thus  chosen  for  the  SVM  model.  It  suggests  that  a  linear  decision 

boundary is appropriate for the set of e-commerce sales data used in this study.

Prediction  accuracy  and  sales  prediction  precision  are  the  metrics  used  to  evaluate  the 

effectiveness  of  the  features  and  models  in  identifying  the  high-sales  item  listings.  Prediction 

accuracy is calculated as the percentage of predictions being correct out of all predictions made. 

Sales prediction precision is calculated as the percentage of high-sales (i.e. positive) predictions 

being  correct  out  of  all  high-sales  (i.e.  positive)  predictions  made.  Prediction  accuracy  and 

precision of the holdout sets are respectively averaged from the 10 cross-validation runs for each 

model type in each scenario. 

 

3  Result Evaluation 

The  first  scenario  sets  up  the  baseline  metrics  for  other  scenarios  with  textual  features  to 

measure  up  against.  The  second  scenario  demonstrates  an  overfitting  situation,  in  which  all 

textual features are being thrown into the model. Including irrelevant features (i.e. nonessential 

words) into the model actually deteriorates the model’s ability to detect high-sales listings from 

those that are not.

Figure 4: Table of Prediction Results by Scenario 

The models  in scenarios III through  VI contain heuristically selected textual features and have 

been found to outperform the baseline scenario in almost all result categories. The performance 

lifts  in  prediction  accuracy  and  sales  prediction  precision  over  random  behavior  and  baseline 

scenario reinforce the notion that certain keywords can be effective indicators of popular online 

listings with high sales volumes.  

 

4   Conclusion 

In  this  study,  a  set  of  online  retail  sales  data  is  examined  to  assess  the  impact  of  listing 

keywords  on  predicting  sales  performance.  Textual  features  are  created  from  the  e-commerce 

dataset,  and  candidate  predictor  variables  are  selected  based  on  correlation  and  AIC  analyses.

Scenarios  are  constructed  to  measure  the  lift  in  predictive  power  of  including  appropriate 

textual  features  into  models  to  classify  sales  popularity.  Experiment  results  suggest  that 

incorporating  certain  keywords  boosts  classifier  accuracy  and  sales  prediction  precision. 

Additional  A/B  testing  can  be  carried  out  to  further  investigate  whether  keywords  actually 

drive  higher  sales  by  setting  up  variant  listings  with  identical  content  except  the  exclusion  of 

keywords in the control group. 

Other  variants  to  this  study  can  be  explored  in  the  future.  Instead  of  employing  greedy 

heuristics in feature selection, models can be optimized by adding regularization directly to the 

objective  functions.  Different  classifier  models  like  naive  Bayes  and  decision  tree  ensemble 

methods  that  do  make  many  assumptions  on  the  underlying  data  distribution  can  also  be 

investigated.  Furthermore,  the  existing  system  design  can  be  tested  on  more  sales  datasets  to 
refine its methodology and prove its validity.
