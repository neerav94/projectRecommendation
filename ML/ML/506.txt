The Human Genome Project1, completed in 2003, opened the door for Big Data approaches to studying 
Mendelian disorders2. In the decade since, hundreds of millions of dollars have gone towards funding 
Genome  Wide  Association  Studies3  (GWAS),  which  have  yielded  interesting  results  but  have  almost 
completely  failed  at  actually  explaining  the  genetic  basis  of  any  diseases4.  Because  of  monetary 
constraints, most GWAS only consider approximately 1-2 million commonly occurring mutations seen on 
SNP arrays5 in order to avoid the costs of sequencing all 3 billion base pairs in the genome. Because 
researchers in the field are slowly abandoning GWAS, much of this SNP array data is now ignored as 
people see more promise in cutting edge techniques such as Next Generation Sequencing6.    
 
Congenital Heart Defects (CHD) are an example of a disease for which GWAS was only able to explain a 
small  percentage  of  cases.  CHD  continues  to  be  the  most  common  birth  defect  in  the  United  States, 
affecting almost 1% of live births7 and increasing in prevalence as time passes8. In this project we set out 
to  salvage  results  from  forgotten  SNP  arrays  for  CHD  patients  by  building  a  classifier  that  predicts 
whether a patient has a congenital heart defect based on his or her genome sequence at 2.5 million SNPs1. 
Because the diagnosis of CHD upon birth is fairly good, achieving 100% classifier accuracy is not critical 
here; instead, our main goal is to identify a minimal feature set of loci (locations in the genome) that 
warrant  further  biological  investigation  as  potentially  causal  agents  of  CHD.  This  is  a  challenging 
problem that many researchers have approached in various forms, and any progress would be considered 
notable in its own right. In order to avoid potentially missing some interesting signal that past researchers 
have overlooked, we consciously try to minimize the amount of false negatives emitted by our classifier.

2.1  Data Preprocessing 
The human genome is full of noisy components that can potentially confound our analysis. In order to 
maintain confidence that any results we find actually reflect a genetic link to congenital heart defects, we 
take a couple steps to control for confounding variables. 
2.1.1  Segmentation of Patients by Ethnic Group 
Ethnic differences between patients are very easily detected in the genome. If the genetic makeup of the 
positive and negative class individuals differs in any way, a classifier on this data would easily be able to 
attain high accuracy simply by giving high weight to the variants that differ between the racial groups; 
this classifier would not learn anything useful about CHD. To control for this, we group all CHD infants 
by ethnicity, as reported by their parents at the time of the study. We choose to focus on the largest ethnic 
group, White infants with CHD, consisting of 73 individuals.

We  now  seek  negative  class  samples  with  a  couple  key  requirements.  First,  these  patients  should  be 
healthy individuals who do not have any form of CHD. Second, these patients must be ethnically similar 
to  our  positive  class  samples,  so  that  the  classifier  does  not  simply  learn  to  detect  ethnic  differences. 
Third, we must be able to access genotype data for these individuals at the same 2.5 million SNPs that we 
have for the positive class patients.

Introduction  

1 
The Human Genome Project1, completed in 2003, opened the door for Big Data approaches to studying 
Mendelian disorders2. In the decade since, hundreds of millions of dollars have gone towards funding 
Genome  Wide  Association  Studies3  (GWAS),  which  have  yielded  interesting  results  but  have  almost

2.1  Data Preprocessing 
The human genome is full of noisy components that can potentially confound our analysis. In order to 
maintain confidence that any results we find actually reflect a genetic link to congenital heart defects, we 
take a couple steps to control for confounding variables. 
2.1.1  Segmentation of Patients by Ethnic Group

group, White infants with CHD, consisting of 73 individuals. 

Introduction of Negative Class via the Thousand Genomes Project 

2.1.2 
We  now  seek  negative  class  samples  with  a  couple  key  requirements.  First,  these  patients  should  be 
healthy individuals who do not have any form of CHD. Second, these patients must be ethnically similar 
to  our  positive  class  samples,  so  that  the  classifier  does  not  simply  learn  to  detect  ethnic  differences. 
Third, we must be able to access genotype data for these individuals at the same 2.5 million SNPs that we 
have for the positive class patients. 
 

                                                        
1 SNP, pronounced “snip,” stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism. A 2.5 million SNP array surveys patient genotypes at 2.5 
million locations in the genome at which a mutation is common. We say that a patient “has” a SNP if he or she has the common 
mutation at that particular location. 

We  notice  that  all  of  these  requirements  appear  to  be  satisfied  by  the  543  individuals  in  the  1000 
Genomes  Project9  who  are  of  European  descent.  To  confirm  that  our  positive  and  negative  class  are 
ethnically similar, we performed a Principal Components Analysis as shown in Figure 1 below. 
 

Figure 1. Principal Components Analysis of positive class samples 
and  negative  class  samples  (who  we  assume  to  all  be  White 
individuals) in addition to Asian and African individuals from the 
1000  Genomes  Project.  Since  the  positive  and  negative  class 
samples cluster together by race, but separately from the other two 
races, this is an indication that racial factors will not confound our 
classifier. 
 
 
 

2.2  Feature Selection 
As  our  primary  goal  is  to  identify  a  minimal  feature  set  that  still  achieves  reasonable  classification 
accuracy on the data, feature selection is the key problem in this project. 

2.2.1  Reduction of Feature Set Using Domain Knowledge 
Prior GWAS studies have already attempted to identify SNPs that may be relevant to CHD. The intent of 
this project is to improve on those studies, not to recreate them. Prior efforts in the Bejerano Lab have 
identified  a  list  of  1179  SNPs  over  10  biological  pathways  that  we  believe  may  be  relevant  to  CHD. 
Therefore we immediately reduce our feature set to these 1179 SNPs and set out to identify key SNPs 
within these pathways. It is not uncommon in genetics for a handful of SNPs to cause a large change in 
phenotype. 

2.2.2  Filter Feature Selection 
We  implement  filter  feature  selection  using  two  separate  metrics,  one  of  which  integrates  domain 
knowledge of genetics. 

2.2.2.1  Filtering by Mutual Information (MI) 
In this version of filter feature selection, we calculate the Mutual Information of every SNP with respect 
to the output variable (disease or no disease) and select the top N SNPs as our feature set, where N is a 
threshold that we determine. 

2.2.2.2  Filtering by Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) Score 
The Transmission Disequilibrium Test10 detects alleles that are in linkage disequilibrium in a population 
of patients with a particular disease. Let’s define A and a to be the major (common) and minor (mutation) 
alleles,  respectively,  at  SNP  i.  If  SNP  i  is  not  associated  with  CHD,  then  allele  transmission  at  SNP  i 
should be uniformly random according to standard genetic laws. That is, we should see that parents with 
genotype Aa at SNP i should be equally likely to transmit either allele (A or a) to their CHD offspring. 
However, if allele a at SNP i is strongly linked to CHD, we would expect to see not uniformly random 
transmission at SNP i, but rather a preponderance of transmission of allele a at this SNP. 
 
At SNP i we look at the genotypes of each CHD child and their parents in order to determine the specific 
allele that each parent transmitted to the child. We then increment one number in the following table for 
each parent: 
 
 

Figure  211:  Illustration  of  Transmission  Disequilibrium  Test. 
No  information  is  given  by  entries  b  and  e  in  the  table  since 
homozygous parents will always transmit one copy of an allele 
and not transmit one copy of the same allele.

The  test  then  uses  a  chi-squared  test  with  one  degree  of  freedom  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  allele 

transmission is random at this locus. 𝜒!=(!!!)!

!!! . We compute this chi-squared statistic at all SNPs in our 

feature set and filter by the associated p-value. 

2.2.2.3  Filtering by a Combination of Mutual Information and Transmission Disequilibrium 
The  most  straightforward  method  of  combining  two  filter  feature  selection  metrics  is  to  “chain”  the 
methods by first filtering by one statistic, and then by the other. We also study the correlation of MI and 
TDT scores over all SNPs.  
Our most effective method examines the overlap of the top N features by MI and the top N features by 
TDT,  for  any  threshold  N.  We  choose  the  N  at  which  the  size  of  the  overlap,  relative  to  N,  is  most 
significant when testing against the null hypothesis that TDT and MI are unrelated. We then examine the 
SNPs in this overlap for biological significance and for efficacy as a reduced feature set. 

2.3  Algorithm Selection 
After  analyzing  the  performance  of  several  classifiers,  including  linear  regression,  logistic  regression, 
Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with various kernels and regularization parameters, 
we  converged  on  a  regularized  SVM  (penalty  coefficient  0.5)  with  a  Gaussian  kernel.  We  found 
empirically that this algorithm did not overfit, and produced the best classifier given our preference for 
false positives over false negatives. Because we have 73 cases and 543 controls, we weight each sample 
inversely proportional to class frequency to account for this. 

3  Results 
We  now  present  some  of  the  more  notable  results  that  illustrate  how  feature  selection  impacts  the 
performance of our classifier. 

3.1  Filter Feature Selection 
Figure  3  below  shows  how  classifier  accuracy  changes  as  a  function  of  feature  set  size.  Interestingly, 
classification  accuracy  is  fairly  robust  to  reduced  feature  set  sizes.  This  may  be  partially  because  of 
linkage disequilibrium, a known genetic phenomenon that posits that inheritance at nearby loci is closely 
linked. Therefore, knowing information about only one SNP in a region is often sufficient to extrapolate 
and obtain information about the remaining SNPs in that same region of the genome. 
 

       

 

 
Figure 3. Classifier accuracy vs. feature set size for top features as determined by Mutual Information 
(left) and Transmission Disequilibrium Test (right). 
 
Further  investigation  shows  that  using  the  top  15  SNPs  by  mutual  information  score  as  a  feature  set 
results in reasonable accuracy (Figure 4). At any feature set size below 15, accuracy rapidly decreases, 
indicating that each SNP being removed from the feature set is critical to classification accuracy.

transmission is random at this locus. 𝜒!=(!!!)!

!!! . We compute this chi-squared statistic at all SNPs in our 

feature set and filter by the associated p-value. 

2.2.2.3  Filtering by a Combination of Mutual Information and Transmission Disequilibrium 
The  most  straightforward  method  of  combining  two  filter  feature  selection  metrics  is  to  “chain”  the 
methods by first filtering by one statistic, and then by the other. We also study the correlation of MI and 
TDT scores over all SNPs.  
Our most effective method examines the overlap of the top N features by MI and the top N features by 
TDT,  for  any  threshold  N.  We  choose  the  N  at  which  the  size  of  the  overlap,  relative  to  N,  is  most 
significant when testing against the null hypothesis that TDT and MI are unrelated. We then examine the 
SNPs in this overlap for biological significance and for efficacy as a reduced feature set. 

2.3  Algorithm Selection 
After  analyzing  the  performance  of  several  classifiers,  including  linear  regression,  logistic  regression, 
Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with various kernels and regularization parameters, 
we  converged  on  a  regularized  SVM  (penalty  coefficient  0.5)  with  a  Gaussian  kernel.  We  found 
empirically that this algorithm did not overfit, and produced the best classifier given our preference for 
false positives over false negatives. Because we have 73 cases and 543 controls, we weight each sample 
inversely proportional to class frequency to account for this. 

3  Results 
We  now  present  some  of  the  more  notable  results  that  illustrate  how  feature  selection  impacts  the 
performance of our classifier. 

3.1  Filter Feature Selection 
Figure  3  below  shows  how  classifier  accuracy  changes  as  a  function  of  feature  set  size.  Interestingly, 
classification  accuracy  is  fairly  robust  to  reduced  feature  set  sizes.  This  may  be  partially  because  of 
linkage disequilibrium, a known genetic phenomenon that posits that inheritance at nearby loci is closely 
linked. Therefore, knowing information about only one SNP in a region is often sufficient to extrapolate 
and obtain information about the remaining SNPs in that same region of the genome.

(left) and Transmission Disequilibrium Test (right). 
 
Further  investigation  shows  that  using  the  top  15  SNPs  by  mutual  information  score  as  a  feature  set 
results in reasonable accuracy (Figure 4). At any feature set size below 15, accuracy rapidly decreases, 
indicating that each SNP being removed from the feature set is critical to classification accuracy.

from Figure 3. Classification accuracy on a feature 
set of size 15 is reasonable, and accuracy decreases 
sharply for each feature that is subsequently removed 
from the feature set. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
The  level  of  accuracy  that  the  classifier  achieves  using  only  15  SNPs  is  quite  high,  leading  us  to  ask 
questions about the underlying distribution of the mutual information and TDT scores. These distributions 
are shown in Figure 5, where it is clear that 9 SNPs have much higher mutual information scores than the 
rest of the feature set.

Predicting using only the top 9 SNPs by mutual information score results in zero classification accuracy 
on the positive class, as represented in Figure 4. However, we still seek a slightly smaller feature set, but 
without  the  fall  in  accuracy  that  is  seen  in  Figure  4.  To  solve  this  problem  we  explore  methods  of 
combining mutual information and TDT in order to select an even smaller feature set. Using the overlap 
method discussed in Section 2.2.2.3, we identify that the top 78 features by mutual information and the 
top 78 features by TDT share 9 SNPs in common, and these 9 SNPs alone have reasonable predictive 
power  as  a  feature  set.  In  fact,  a  classifier  using  this  feature  set  of  9  SNPs  has  effectively  the  same 
accuracy on the positive class as a classifier using the top 100 features by mutual information does. These 
results are shown in Figure 6.

Introduction  

1 
The Human Genome Project1, completed in 2003, opened the door for Big Data approaches to studying 
Mendelian disorders2. In the decade since, hundreds of millions of dollars have gone towards funding 
Genome  Wide  Association  Studies3  (GWAS),  which  have  yielded  interesting  results  but  have  almost 
completely  failed  at  actually  explaining  the  genetic  basis  of  any  diseases4.  Because  of  monetary 
constraints, most GWAS only consider approximately 1-2 million commonly occurring mutations seen on 
SNP arrays5 in order to avoid the costs of sequencing all 3 billion base pairs in the genome. Because 
researchers in the field are slowly abandoning GWAS, much of this SNP array data is now ignored as 
people see more promise in cutting edge techniques such as Next Generation Sequencing6.    
 
Congenital Heart Defects (CHD) are an example of a disease for which GWAS was only able to explain a 
small  percentage  of  cases.  CHD  continues  to  be  the  most  common  birth  defect  in  the  United  States, 
affecting almost 1% of live births7 and increasing in prevalence as time passes8. In this project we set out 
to  salvage  results  from  forgotten  SNP  arrays  for  CHD  patients  by  building  a  classifier  that  predicts 
whether a patient has a congenital heart defect based on his or her genome sequence at 2.5 million SNPs1. 
Because the diagnosis of CHD upon birth is fairly good, achieving 100% classifier accuracy is not critical 
here; instead, our main goal is to identify a minimal feature set of loci (locations in the genome) that 
warrant  further  biological  investigation  as  potentially  causal  agents  of  CHD.  This  is  a  challenging 
problem that many researchers have approached in various forms, and any progress would be considered 
notable in its own right. In order to avoid potentially missing some interesting signal that past researchers 
have overlooked, we consciously try to minimize the amount of false negatives emitted by our classifier. 
2  Methods 

2.1  Data Preprocessing 
The human genome is full of noisy components that can potentially confound our analysis. In order to 
maintain confidence that any results we find actually reflect a genetic link to congenital heart defects, we 
take a couple steps to control for confounding variables. 
2.1.1  Segmentation of Patients by Ethnic Group 
Ethnic differences between patients are very easily detected in the genome. If the genetic makeup of the 
positive and negative class individuals differs in any way, a classifier on this data would easily be able to 
attain high accuracy simply by giving high weight to the variants that differ between the racial groups; 
this classifier would not learn anything useful about CHD. To control for this, we group all CHD infants 
by ethnicity, as reported by their parents at the time of the study. We choose to focus on the largest ethnic 
group, White infants with CHD, consisting of 73 individuals. 

Introduction of Negative Class via the Thousand Genomes Project 

2.1.2 
We  now  seek  negative  class  samples  with  a  couple  key  requirements.  First,  these  patients  should  be 
healthy individuals who do not have any form of CHD. Second, these patients must be ethnically similar 
to  our  positive  class  samples,  so  that  the  classifier  does  not  simply  learn  to  detect  ethnic  differences. 
Third, we must be able to access genotype data for these individuals at the same 2.5 million SNPs that we 
have for the positive class patients. 
 

                                                        
1 SNP, pronounced “snip,” stands for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism. A 2.5 million SNP array surveys patient genotypes at 2.5 
million locations in the genome at which a mutation is common. We say that a patient “has” a SNP if he or she has the common 
mutation at that particular location. 

We  notice  that  all  of  these  requirements  appear  to  be  satisfied  by  the  543  individuals  in  the  1000 
Genomes  Project9  who  are  of  European  descent.  To  confirm  that  our  positive  and  negative  class  are 
ethnically similar, we performed a Principal Components Analysis as shown in Figure 1 below. 
 

Figure 1. Principal Components Analysis of positive class samples 
and  negative  class  samples  (who  we  assume  to  all  be  White 
individuals) in addition to Asian and African individuals from the 
1000  Genomes  Project.  Since  the  positive  and  negative  class 
samples cluster together by race, but separately from the other two 
races, this is an indication that racial factors will not confound our 
classifier. 
 
 
 

2.2  Feature Selection 
As  our  primary  goal  is  to  identify  a  minimal  feature  set  that  still  achieves  reasonable  classification 
accuracy on the data, feature selection is the key problem in this project. 

2.2.1  Reduction of Feature Set Using Domain Knowledge 
Prior GWAS studies have already attempted to identify SNPs that may be relevant to CHD. The intent of 
this project is to improve on those studies, not to recreate them. Prior efforts in the Bejerano Lab have 
identified  a  list  of  1179  SNPs  over  10  biological  pathways  that  we  believe  may  be  relevant  to  CHD. 
Therefore we immediately reduce our feature set to these 1179 SNPs and set out to identify key SNPs 
within these pathways. It is not uncommon in genetics for a handful of SNPs to cause a large change in 
phenotype. 

2.2.2  Filter Feature Selection 
We  implement  filter  feature  selection  using  two  separate  metrics,  one  of  which  integrates  domain 
knowledge of genetics. 

2.2.2.1  Filtering by Mutual Information (MI) 
In this version of filter feature selection, we calculate the Mutual Information of every SNP with respect 
to the output variable (disease or no disease) and select the top N SNPs as our feature set, where N is a 
threshold that we determine. 

2.2.2.2  Filtering by Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) Score 
The Transmission Disequilibrium Test10 detects alleles that are in linkage disequilibrium in a population 
of patients with a particular disease. Let’s define A and a to be the major (common) and minor (mutation) 
alleles,  respectively,  at  SNP  i.  If  SNP  i  is  not  associated  with  CHD,  then  allele  transmission  at  SNP  i 
should be uniformly random according to standard genetic laws. That is, we should see that parents with 
genotype Aa at SNP i should be equally likely to transmit either allele (A or a) to their CHD offspring. 
However, if allele a at SNP i is strongly linked to CHD, we would expect to see not uniformly random 
transmission at SNP i, but rather a preponderance of transmission of allele a at this SNP. 
 
At SNP i we look at the genotypes of each CHD child and their parents in order to determine the specific 
allele that each parent transmitted to the child. We then increment one number in the following table for 
each parent: 
 
 

Figure  211:  Illustration  of  Transmission  Disequilibrium  Test. 
No  information  is  given  by  entries  b  and  e  in  the  table  since 
homozygous parents will always transmit one copy of an allele 
and not transmit one copy of the same allele.

The  test  then  uses  a  chi-squared  test  with  one  degree  of  freedom  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  allele 

transmission is random at this locus. 𝜒!=(!!!)!

!!! . We compute this chi-squared statistic at all SNPs in our 

feature set and filter by the associated p-value. 

2.2.2.3  Filtering by a Combination of Mutual Information and Transmission Disequilibrium 
The  most  straightforward  method  of  combining  two  filter  feature  selection  metrics  is  to  “chain”  the 
methods by first filtering by one statistic, and then by the other. We also study the correlation of MI and 
TDT scores over all SNPs.  
Our most effective method examines the overlap of the top N features by MI and the top N features by 
TDT,  for  any  threshold  N.  We  choose  the  N  at  which  the  size  of  the  overlap,  relative  to  N,  is  most 
significant when testing against the null hypothesis that TDT and MI are unrelated. We then examine the 
SNPs in this overlap for biological significance and for efficacy as a reduced feature set. 

2.3  Algorithm Selection 
After  analyzing  the  performance  of  several  classifiers,  including  linear  regression,  logistic  regression, 
Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with various kernels and regularization parameters,

empirically that this algorithm did not overfit, and produced the best classifier given our preference for

performance of our classifier.

results in reasonable accuracy (Figure 4). At any feature set size below 15, accuracy rapidly decreases, 
indicating that each SNP being removed from the feature set is critical to classification accuracy.

distribution  of  these  9  SNPs  in  the  original  10  biological  pathways  that  we  started  with.  Biological 
pathways can share SNPs, especially if the pathways correspond to similar function. This distribution is

4  Discussion 
By integrating domain knowledge of genetics and genomics with traditional machine learning techniques 
we were able to improve on previous results and identify 9 SNPs and 2 biological pathways that warrant 
further investigation as potentially causal agents of CHD. These links cannot be validated until further 
biological  experimentation  is  carried  out.  If  any  of  these  SNPs  or  pathways  does  show  a  new  link  to 
CHD,  we  will  have  successfully  salvaged  new  information  from  data  that  many  researchers  have  long 
forgotten.
