Introduction 
 
Dental caries, or tooth decay/cavity, is a dental disease caused by bacterial infection. Of people 
from different age groups, preschooler children requires more attention since caries has become 
the most common chronic childhood diseases. More importantly, a skewed distribution of the 
diseases has been observed in Europe, US and Singapore among the children or preschoolers, 
which indicate a small portion of the population endures a big portion of caries incidences. 
Therefore, there is still the need to improve on the current caries control to identify the high-risk 
individuals and prevent resurgence in children in developed countries like Singapore. Our project 
will study on the data such as questionnaire responses, oral examination and biological tests of 
certain preschoolers from Singapore and use suitable learning methods to predict whether they 
have carries now and whether they are likely to get dental caries in the future. 
  
The final target of this project is to give a reasonable prediction on preschoolers’ dental caries rate 
based on the chosen statistical learning model and to reduce the feature space in order to improve 
the utility of the models in the clinic context.

The questionnaire includes information from demographic background, socioeconomic status, oral 
health history, fluoride applications, utilization of dental care services, systemic diseases and 
regular medication, and parent’s attitude towards caries. Clinical examination and biologic tests 
were administered to collect data on several clinical and biologic risk factors such as plaque 
amount, baseline caries existence, saliva flow rate, saliva buffering capacity, level of lactobacilli 
(LB), level of mutans (MS), and plaque PH.  
 
In general, the questionnaire requires least amount of monetary input. The biologic tests incur the 
most cost and prolonged period of data collection. The oral examination lies in between.

Some attributes of the collected data are missing because of the missing fields in the collected

3.  Model 
 
We construct the learning models based on 3 types of data space: Prediction (Full-Blown), 
Prediction (Screening), and Community Screening. Prediction (Screening) and Prediction (Full-
Blown) are utilized to predict the incremental caries existence, i.e. number of new caries forming 
in next year. The difference between prediction screening and prediction full-blown lies in the use 
of expensive and long-waiting biological tests data. Community screening is used to predict 
baseline caries existence by employing the data only in questionnaire. It serves to identify high-
risk children in a community setting since it is costly and time consuming to perform the oral 
examination directly.

compare and contrast Linear (e.g. SVM (Linear Kernel)) vs Gaussian (e.g. SVM (rbf Kernel)). 
Based on the comparison, we get insight into the data and explore how to select different models 
based on the property of the data. We use Matlab to implement the methods. data is split out into 
training and testing set (70% for training and 30% for testing).  For feature selection, we use 
wrapper method with aid of forward search.

Overall, prediction (full-blown) has best accuracy with prediction (screening) coming after. 
Community screening model has worst performance in the end. Such results showcase that high 
cost features like oral examination (clinical exam as in the table) and biologic tests play more 
dominant role in determining the outcomes. Moreover, we find that linear learning models such as 
Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis have a relatively better performance than 
non-linear models. Our conjecture is that the data set tends to be easily over fitted by using a high-
dimensional classification method (SVM using Gaussian kernel). The best classification comes 
from LDA, which has 14.15% classification error.  
 
We included the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graph for the above 3 data spaces in 
Figure 1-3 

 

 

       

Figure 1-3: ROC Curve for each of the learning algorithms for each model 

From the ROC curve, we can see that it is a tight fight among SVM(linear kennel), LDA and 
Logistics Regression in Prediction(Full-Blown) and Prediction(Screening), and they are well 
above the SVM(polynomial) and SVM(rbf Gaussian). However, as we delete the features from 
oral examination and biologic tests in the community-screening model, the advantage diminishes. 
The reason behind is that inappropriate feature space will distort the power of the good learning 
algorithms since the oral examination and biologic tests links more directly to the outcome of 
caries. 
 
5.2  Feature Selection Results and Reduced Models’ Results 
 
     To fully explore the performance of the statistical models and reduce the workload of clinicians 
by shrinking the feature space, we perform feature selection using LDA for Prediction Full-Blown, 
Prediction Screening and community screening. We selected LDA since it performs almost as 
good as logistic regression and it’s time efficient. The selected features for each model are listed 
in the following: 
For the Prediction Full-Blown model, we selected: Singapore Nationality, Advise of diet and 
caries, LB level, MS bacteria level, average PH of saliva and baseline caries existence. For 
Prediction Screening, we only select main reasons of tooth decay – heatiness and baseline year 
caries existence. For the Community Screening model, we select race of Indian, children taken 
care by child care service and parents awareness of children’s caries.  
 
 
The performance after the feature selection is listed in Table 7:

In addition to the initial model construction, we develop models with reduced feature space via 
feature selection. It will not only have influence on the model performance, but also improve the 
model utility in clinical trials. 
 
4.  Method 
 
We build up 5 methods for the outcome variables (Baseline year caries existence and Incremental 
caries existence) for each of the above model. The five methods are SVM (Linear Kernel), 

SVM(Gaussian Kernel), SVM (polynomial Kernel), Logistic Regression and LDA. We construct 
these models because they are most frequently used methods for categorical prediction. We 
compare and contrast Linear (e.g. SVM (Linear Kernel)) vs Gaussian (e.g. SVM (rbf Kernel)). 
Based on the comparison, we get insight into the data and explore how to select different models 
based on the property of the data. We use Matlab to implement the methods. data is split out into 
training and testing set (70% for training and 30% for testing).  For feature selection, we use 
wrapper method with aid of forward search. 
 
5.   Results and Discussion

Table 6: Community Screening Performance 

                                      
 

Overall, prediction (full-blown) has best accuracy with prediction (screening) coming after. 
Community screening model has worst performance in the end. Such results showcase that high 
cost features like oral examination (clinical exam as in the table) and biologic tests play more 
dominant role in determining the outcomes. Moreover, we find that linear learning models such as 
Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis have a relatively better performance than 
non-linear models. Our conjecture is that the data set tends to be easily over fitted by using a high-
dimensional classification method (SVM using Gaussian kernel). The best classification comes 
from LDA, which has 14.15% classification error.  
 
We included the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graph for the above 3 data spaces in 
Figure 1-3 

 

 

       

Figure 1-3: ROC Curve for each of the learning algorithms for each model 

From the ROC curve, we can see that it is a tight fight among SVM(linear kennel), LDA and 
Logistics Regression in Prediction(Full-Blown) and Prediction(Screening), and they are well 
above the SVM(polynomial) and SVM(rbf Gaussian). However, as we delete the features from 
oral examination and biologic tests in the community-screening model, the advantage diminishes. 
The reason behind is that inappropriate feature space will distort the power of the good learning 
algorithms since the oral examination and biologic tests links more directly to the outcome of 
caries. 
 
5.2  Feature Selection Results and Reduced Models’ Results 
 
     To fully explore the performance of the statistical models and reduce the workload of clinicians 
by shrinking the feature space, we perform feature selection using LDA for Prediction Full-Blown, 
Prediction Screening and community screening. We selected LDA since it performs almost as 
good as logistic regression and it’s time efficient. The selected features for each model are listed 
in the following: 
For the Prediction Full-Blown model, we selected: Singapore Nationality, Advise of diet and 
caries, LB level, MS bacteria level, average PH of saliva and baseline caries existence. For 
Prediction Screening, we only select main reasons of tooth decay – heatiness and baseline year 
caries existence. For the Community Screening model, we select race of Indian, children taken 
care by child care service and parents awareness of children’s caries.  
 
 
The performance after the feature selection is listed in Table 7:

The ROC comparison of data spaces before and after feature selection is shown in Figure  
4 – 6.

We observe that the performance of reduced model is slightly inferior for high true positive region 
in Prediction Full Blown model, even though the performance is similar. However, for other two 
cases, the performance is indeed inferior in the other two models. The problem can be related to 
the feature selection method we employed. Since we only use wrapper method with forward 
search, it will stop early if the algorithm finds an addition feature which does not improve on its 
performance. However, there might exist a set of features (does not include current selected 
features) that has better performance but is neglected because of the non-exhaustive search. 
Therefore, the performances are inferior to the full models, even though in theory, the feature 
selection would improve the overall performance when the subsets of features were exhaustively 
searched. 
 
6.  Conclusion: 
 
In this project, various statistics models with employment of different machine learning 
algorithms are developed and compared with each other. In addition, we figure out different subset 
of features for each model, which contribute to strike a balance between model performance and 
clinical utility. Nevertheless, there is much more opportunities in future to further develop this 
Caries Risk Assessment Model. A summary of further development is followed: 
 
    Extending our model to different outcome variables, i.e. number of caries, position of    
      caries surfaces, etc.  
 Optimizing the feature selection process, i.e. use backward/genetic search and    
incorporate a penalty cost for number of features selected to avoid the increasing  
number of features selected in the backward/genetic search. 
 Determination of optimal sample size to reduce the amount of effort in collecting  
      ample amout of data which are very costly in research settings.
