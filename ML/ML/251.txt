A supervised binary 10 classification problem is defined to distinguish damaged steel specimens 11 from intact specimens. Sets of time-series wave propagation data collected 12 by the fatigue crack sensor are utilized for the proposed scheme. In order to 13 apply supervised learning methods, different feature sets are defined based 14 on the sensor data using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Two-third of 15 collected data are used as the training set while the rest are used as the test 16 set. The preliminary analysis shows that the features consisting of amplitude 17 distribution in frequency domain and the quadratic kernel function yield the 18 most desirable performance. The trained SVM model, however, performs 19 not very well for the test data set and needs to be improved, especially with 20 larger data sets to reduce high variance. Nevertheless, the proposed learning 21 scheme implies that the wave propagation data has some trend reflecting 22 damage state of a specimen, which shows a great potential of machine 23 learning techniques for fatigue crack analysis.  24  25 1 Introduction 26 As sensor technologies mature and become economically affordable, the use of sensors for 27 the health monitoring of infrastructures, such as bridges, will continue to grow [1]. 28 Developments of advanced sensing materials and devices, e.g. piezo lead zirconate titanate 29 (PZT) and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, can also provide measurements for detailed 30 and precise structural evaluation [2, 3]. Together with routine maintenance and inspection 31 reports, the collected sensor data is expected to enable the diagnosis of potential structural 32 problems and the prognosis for the need of structural strengthening and repairs. While 33 current research trends of fatigue crack sensor mainly focus on the physical model based 34 analysis to find cracks in infrastructure, little efforts have been spent on the machine learning 35 based scheme, which has great potential with increasing amount of sensor data. The data 36 analysis issues need to be dealt with to reduce the computational cost of the model based 37 analysis as well as to find data patterns that has significant correlation with the level of 38 damage. 39 In this project, a data-driven crack evaluation method based on the machine learning 40 techniques is proposed to better support the decision making process of bridge owners. First 41 of all, I defined a supervised binary classification problem to distinguish damaged and 42 undamaged specimens. To develop and validate the proposed method, I prepared wave 43 propagation data sets collected using a fatigue crack sensor developed by Lim et al [4], and 44 divide the data into training set and test set. A few dog-bone steel specimens whose true 45 damage status are already known are used for the wave propagation test [4]. The raw sensor 46 data is pre-processed using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) so that different features that 47 
might represent the damage pattern can be extracted. Four different feature combinations are 48 defined for preliminary training stage to find the most promising feature set for crack 49 evaluation. In addition, different kernel functions for support vector machine (SVM) are 50 implemented to reduce the training error. Lastly, the trained model is evaluated based on the 51 test data set.  52  53 2 Related work 54 Research efforts on bridge monitoring and damage evaluation mostly focus on the traditional 55 physical model based approaches, while little research efforts have started to attempt to 56 implement machine learning method for the bridge management. Many studies on damage 57 detection method proposed probabilistic model updating schemes based on finite element 58 (FE) model of a structure [5, 6]. For example, Iman and Babak conducted probabilistic 59 identification of a simulate damage on the Dowling Hall footbridge using Bayesian finite 60 element (FE) model updating based on Markov chain sampling [6]. While this approach 61 works well for the very significant damage of a simple bridge, but it is not appropriate to 62 catch the onset of a damage and to evaluate complex structures involving very large degree 63 of freedom followed by enormous computational cost.  64 To overcome such limitation and to detect the onset of damage, advanced sensing materials 65 and sensors are developed and utilized [2, 3, 7]. A fatigue crack sensor proposed by Lim, for 66 example, shows great performance to catch very tiny crack on a specimen based on the 67 ultrasonic features collected by sensor [4]. However, this method requires many different 68 combination of excitation to detect a small damage followed by long sensing duration.  69 On the other hands, some studies have started to implement machine learning methods for  70 bridge management applications. OConnor et al implemented Gaussian Process Regression 71 (GPR) to find the environmental impacts on the behavior of Telegraph Road Bridge, MI, and 72 suggested that there is a bilinear correlation between temperature and the natural frequency 73 of the bridge [8]. Green et al also suggested machine learning based system identification of 74 dynamical system scheme and showed that the proposed method performs well to predict the 75 Tamar bridges traffic-dependent behavior [9]. However, the machine learning applications 76 in bridge management are still very limited, and especially researchers rarely spent research 77 efforts on the application of machine learning techniques to evaluate structural damages. 78  79 3 Data set and features 80 The fatigue crack sensor system consists of two exciters and sensor(s), and the exciters 81 creates high and low frequency wave, respectively [4]. Once the exciters creates wave 82 propagation, the sensor measures time-series vibration data as described in Figure 1 (a). The 83 sampling rate is 1.0 MHz and the sampling duration is 0.5 second per an excitation event. For 84 excitation, six frequency values ranged from 180 kHz to 185 kHz are used for high frequency 85 (HF) excitation, while a single frequency (45 kHz) is used for the low frequency (LF) 86 excitation. Nine steel specimens are prepared where five of them are intact and four of them 87 are damaged. In addition, two sensors are installed for each specimen. As a result, I have 108 88 data sets as calculated by Equation (1).  89 !!!"!!!!!!"!!!!!!"#$%&#'!!!!!!"#!$%!!"#!!"#$%&#'!!"# (1) In this project 72 data sets serve as the training set and the rest 36 data sets are used for 90 testing trained models. 91 I prepared four different feature combinations that have potential to represent damage state 92 of specimens, and pre-processed the data to extract those features. For the first feature sets, 93 the raw time-series data is discretized into 1, 2, 5, and 10 buckets, and the mean, standard 94 deviation, maximum, and minimum amplitude are calculated for each bucket. The time-series 95 data is also transformed into frequency domain, as shown in Figure 1(b), to extract features 96 from the distribution of frequency contribution for the second, third and fourth feature 97 combinations. The selected feature combinations are described in Table 1. 98  99

Support 107 Vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most powerful supervised learning algorithm 108 classifying labelled data. For the separable data set, SVMs find the best hyperplane that 109 separate all data points into the currect classes with the largest margin [10]. Finding the best 110 hyperplane can be descirbed as an optimization problem as Equation (2), whose solution 111 gives the optimal margin classifier.  112 !"#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (2) The optimization problem in Equation (2) can be described as a Lagragian as Equation (3), 113 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (3) where !! is Lagrange multipliers. By minimizing Equation (3) with respect to ! and !, we 114 can obtain the dual optimization problem as described in Equation (4), which is 115 computationally simpler to solve than the primal problem. 116 !"#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (4) Instead of using the input attribtues !!!! in Equation (5), we can map the attributes to some 117 new set of quatities !!!!!!!, which called feature mapping.

(5) Note that computing the Kernel takes only !!!! times, while computing the feature 120 mapping !!!! explictly take !!!!!. This is called kernel trick, and it makes applying 121 SVMs in high dimensional feature space very efficient.  122 
For the non-separable data set, SVMs can use a soft margin that permits some data point 123 have functional margin less than 1. In other words, the hyperplane now do not necessarily 124 separate all data points currectly [10]. The optimization problem for the non-separable case 125 is described in Equation (6), where !! is slack variable and ! is a penalty parameter. 126 !"#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(7)  129 5 Experiment result and discussion 130 Due to the lack of prior knowledge of the relation between features and target, I tried 131 different kernels including linear kernel, quadratic kernel, and Gaussian kernel. Since the 132 given data set is not guaranteed to be separable, the box constraint C is defined. I firstly set C 133 as a large value (e.g. 10) and continuouly decrease it to get better training accuracy. The 134 result shows that the training accuracy is highest when C is 1. The k-folds validation is 135 implemented to prevent over fitting. I used k=10 folds which is a typical choice for k. The 136 primary metrics in the training stage are the high training accuracy as well as small 137 false-negative ratio, because the ultimate goal of this project is to evaluate damage of bridge 138 structure, where a certain level of safety margin is desirable while false-negative evaluations 139 may lead very disastrous result along with a great loss to the society. 140 Firstly, the data point distributions of each feature set are plotted in Figure 2 to choose the 141 most appropriate feature set. Figure 2 shows that the feature set 3 has significant trend that 142 divides the damaged set from the intact sets. The training accuracy for each feature set can 143 also be found in Table 2. Figure 3 shows the ROC curves and confusion matrices of SVMs 144 using linear, quadratic, and gaussian kernel with the feature set 3, and the corresponding 145 training accuracy can be found in Table 2. The training results indicate that the SVM with 146 the quatratic kernel has the best results in terms of the defined metric - training accuracy and 147 false-negative ratio.  148  149     (a) Feature set 1 (b) Feature set 2 (c) Feature set 3 (d) Feature set 4 Figure 2: Data point distribution of each feature set 150  151 Table 2: Training accuracy of SVMs 152 Set No. Linear kernel Quadratic kernel Gaussian kernel Set 1 70.8% 72.2% 58.3% Set 2 66.7% 68.1% 58.3% Set 3 65.3% 93.1% 50.0% Set 4 52.8% 68.1% 50.0%

Figure 4 describes the distribution of data point of entire 158 data set and the confusion matrix for the test set. Unfortunately, the test accuracy is much 159 poorer than the training set and the false-negative ratio is also unacceptable. One of the main 160 reason of this high variance problem would be the insufficient data points, since only 108 161 data points are used in this project. Another typical way to settle the high variance problem is 162 to reduce the number of features, but the number of features used for the test is not very large, 163 so that the feature-reducing scheme is not applicable here. Rather, it might be worth a try to 164 define different feature sets based on the additional prior knowledge about the correlation 165 between wave propagation properties and damage states. 166  167 6 Conclusion 168 In this study, a machine learning based fatigue crack evaluation method is proposed. Sets of 169 wave propagation data collected by fatigue crack sensor are prepared for the training and test 170 data, and DFT is performed to extract meaningful information from the raw data. SVMs are 171 applied to solve the classification problem distinguishing damaged and intact specimen, and 172 the quadratic kernel function shows better result than other kernels. The proposed method 173 performs well for the training set, while the trained model result in an inaccurate 174 classification result for the test data set. In the future work, I will prepare more data set and 175 try different features to reduce high variance, and thus, improve the proposed method. 176 Acknowledgments 177 The information, photos, and sensor data of fatigue crack sensor used in this project are 178 provided by Prof. Hoon Sohn and Dr. Hyung Jin Lim of KAIST. 179
