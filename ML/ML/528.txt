DATA GENERATION AND FEATURE SELECTION 
The data generation program, ‘datagen’, was obtained from the website of the IASC-ASCE SHM 
Task Group. In the simulation, the excitations were modeled either as the independent filtered 
Gaussian white noise or the direct shake at the roof level. Nonlinear structural time history 
analysis was performed to get the acceleration time histories using Nigam-Jennings integration 
method with a damping ratio of 2% and a noise level of 10.This method decomposed the 
structural system into its modal space, integrated each mode assuming the excitation was 
piecewise-linear over a time step, and superimposed to get the time history responses. The 
acceleration data sets used in this project were then generated using different random seeds using 
the ‘datagen’ program in Matlab. The typical acceleration time history data is shown below in 
Fig.2. In this project, the acceleration records generated last for 700s with a time step of 0.001s, 
thus the acceleration data has 700,000 rows and 16 columns, which represent the 16 different 
locations of the sensors. 
 
Yet, if the raw data were used directly as the input matrix, a high variance problem would rise as 
a result of over-fitting. Also, acceleration time history itself could not directly represent the 
damage-related behavior of the structure. Thus, to preprocess the data, several damage sensitive 
features (DSFs) were extracted by fitting an optimal autoregressive (AR) model with an order of 
8 to each time history record, which was the smallest order that could be used to achieve a stable 
behavior. AR coefficients obtained from this model could directly represent the natural 
frequencies of the structure in various damage states, thus these coefficients could be combined 
to compute the Damage Sensitive Features (DSFs), which could most effectively represent the 
seismic behavior of the structure.

Each acceleration time series was divided into 100 segments with each segment containing 7000 
data. The data per segment was then normalized and an optimal AR model with an order of 8 
was fitted to the model and the corresponding coefficients were obtained using Matlab built-in 
function “arbug”. DSFs were then computed as functions of AR coefficients, with the number of 
DSFs and orders of coefficients determined by a forward search algorithm. Three basic DSFs,

also selected to be the other three features. Different random seeds were used to generate 
acceleration data at each location 10 times for one undamaged and two damaged states 
respectively, and then the DSFs were computed accordingly. Thus, the inputs have 8 features in 
total, with total 48,000 data sets for training. (m=48,000, n=8.) To better use these data to train 
the models, 5000 samples were randomly selected from these data sets several times and the

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION 
Because this problem is a binary classification problem, several classification algorithms were 
selected as potential candidates. 
 
Naive Bayes was first tried for a quick start because it was easier and faster to implement 
compared to other methods. A uniformly distributed prior was used for the damage states and 
Naive Bayes algorithm was performed in Matlab using the Naive Bayes class. The results 

indicated fairly large training and testing errors of 45% and 33%, respectively. Yet the 
performance of the algorithm could not be further improved efficiently by adding more features, 
which implied there were issues with the model itself as we had a high bias problem. This was 
because the prior distribution used in this model might not be appropriate. However, trying 
multiple of other distributions for the prior could not significantly improve the results, indicating 
more studies need to be done on the damage states definition so as to come up with more suitable 
and case-specific prior distribution for applying the Bayesian algorithm. 

As the DSFs are approximately Normal distributed, the Gaussian Discriminant Analysis was 
then used and a multivariate Normal distribution was fitted to each 100 sets of features per 
acceleration and the mean and covariance matrix were computed for undamaged and damaged 
states. The training and testing errors were 22% and 24%, which were better than those from the 
Naive Bayes model. Also, by computing the KL divergence of the probability density functions 
of the features with undamaged and damaged states, a threshold of the KL value was obtained. 
The structure can be classified as damaged if this value has been exceeded. However, this 
method requires a larger set of data then those data previously described to get an optimal 
threshold (the data in this case needs to be grouped for each acceleration record). As a 
consequence, the training and testing error obtained using this method were fairly large: 32.1% 
and 33.4%.  
 
Logistic Regression algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were then tried to 
classify the damage state of the structure in the next step. Matlab toolbox and Liblinear-1.94 
package were used and surprisingly errors associated with SVM were large (30% and 33% for 
training and testing respectively), while Logistic Regression model gave a relatively smaller 
training and testing error of 15% and 16%. Different kernels for SVM were tried, and the 
training and testing errors were successfully reduced after conducting the kernel and feature 
selection (the Gaussian Kernel gave the best results), yet still Logistic Regression Model 
performed much better. 

To further develop a better model, Neural Network algorithm with 10 hidden neurons and 2 
output layers was used to train a model. The neural network algorithm was implemented in 
Matlab using nprtool. And the network was trained to classify the inputs according to the labels 
using scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation. In structural engineering practice, engineers 
are more interested and concerned about minimizing the mislabeling error associated with the 
case when damaged state is mislabeled as undamaged state. The confusion matrix indicated this 
mislabeling error was as low as about 5% for both training and testing. Other network layouts 
were tired with different number of hidden neurons, some generated fairly small total errors, but 
with higher error for damaged misclassified as undamaged. Thus, even the total error was 
relatively larger; the 10 hidden neurons layout was chosen to be the optimal model as the 
interested error was the smallest.

which implied there were issues with the model itself as we had a high bias problem. This was 
because the prior distribution used in this model might not be appropriate. However, trying 
multiple of other distributions for the prior could not significantly improve the results, indicating 
more studies need to be done on the damage states definition so as to come up with more suitable 
and case-specific prior distribution for applying the Bayesian algorithm. 

As the DSFs are approximately Normal distributed, the Gaussian Discriminant Analysis was 
then used and a multivariate Normal distribution was fitted to each 100 sets of features per 
acceleration and the mean and covariance matrix were computed for undamaged and damaged 
states. The training and testing errors were 22% and 24%, which were better than those from the 
Naive Bayes model. Also, by computing the KL divergence of the probability density functions 
of the features with undamaged and damaged states, a threshold of the KL value was obtained. 
The structure can be classified as damaged if this value has been exceeded. However, this 
method requires a larger set of data then those data previously described to get an optimal 
threshold (the data in this case needs to be grouped for each acceleration record). As a 
consequence, the training and testing error obtained using this method were fairly large: 32.1% 
and 33.4%.  
 
Logistic Regression algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were then tried to 
classify the damage state of the structure in the next step. Matlab toolbox and Liblinear-1.94 
package were used and surprisingly errors associated with SVM were large (30% and 33% for 
training and testing respectively), while Logistic Regression model gave a relatively smaller 
training and testing error of 15% and 16%. Different kernels for SVM were tried, and the 
training and testing errors were successfully reduced after conducting the kernel and feature 
selection (the Gaussian Kernel gave the best results), yet still Logistic Regression Model 
performed much better. 

To further develop a better model, Neural Network algorithm with 10 hidden neurons and 2 
output layers was used to train a model. The neural network algorithm was implemented in 
Matlab using nprtool. And the network was trained to classify the inputs according to the labels 
using scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation. In structural engineering practice, engineers 
are more interested and concerned about minimizing the mislabeling error associated with the 
case when damaged state is mislabeled as undamaged state. The confusion matrix indicated this 
mislabeling error was as low as about 5% for both training and testing. Other network layouts 
were tired with different number of hidden neurons, some generated fairly small total errors, but 
with higher error for damaged misclassified as undamaged. Thus, even the total error was 
relatively larger; the 10 hidden neurons layout was chosen to be the optimal model as the 
interested error was the smallest.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
Lots of features were included at first, resulting in a high variance problem in the model. By 
engaging only the appropriate damage sensitive features, the model seemed to have a high bias 
problem; yet adding more features could not really resolve this issue because of the complex 
property of DSFs. However, the best training and testing performance was achieved using 8 
features, which could generate relatively accurate results.  
 
As in this problem, the prior of the damaged states were difficult to define; using only a uniform 
distribution to estimate the prior was not accurate enough, thus errors in Naive Bayes model 
using uniform priors were fairly large. As in real life, the damage situation is hard to describe 
with the lack of the statistical data, more studies on describing the prior distribution of the 
damage state are needed before more accurately using the Bayesian algorithm. 
 
The results indicate that the Logistic Regression Model and the Neural Network Model were 
capable of generating the best performance, and thus are recommended for future prediction of 
the health performance of the structure in extreme events, such as earthquakes. 

FUTURE OBJECTIVES 
When including the data associated with a minor damage state, i.e. just removing the braces from 
one floor, it turned out that the data were barely separable and the training and testing errors 
were both very high. Thus one of the next steps in the future is to find out how to describe this 
more complicated situation and engage more specific major and minor damage states, i.e. revise 
the labels to 1-6 damage states. Features that are more sensitive to structural damages could be 
discovered following structural experiment testing and more algorithms could be tried in the 
future to come up with better machine learning models.
