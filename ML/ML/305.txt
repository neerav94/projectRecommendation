Abstract

We aim to predict individual’s age, gender
and number of ﬁngers they used to type based on
their typing on mobile phones. Although similar
work has been done predict a user’s information,
it has been based on either content of the text or
typing style on keyboards instead of analyzing the
user’s movement patterns. We created our own
dataset by building an iOS application we called
Typeguess, which allowed us to collect data in per-
son. We then generated 29 features to observe. We
did feature analysis for each classiﬁer and followed
it with model selection. Finally we were able to
select top features and the best working models for
classifying age, gender and number of ﬁngers used
to type. Best results achieved were respectively
0.752, 0.603, 0.809 on balanced accuracy.

1 Background

Keystroke Dynamics based Authentication
(KDA) related work was also conducted for mo-
bile phones. Most of this research was based on
decreasing errors for user authentication and they
were conducted on handheld phones which didn’t
provide sensor information.

Introduction

Diﬀerent from the previous work on KDA
our project was focused on predicting actual in-
formation about the users based on the keystroke
dynamics and phone sensor information. With our
project TypeGuess we aim to predict individuals
typing style (number of ﬁngers), age and gender as
they type.

3 Dataset

Personal identiﬁers are a subset of of infor-
mation that alone or combined with certain infor-
mation can identify a unique individual. Most of
the current PIDs are either biometric such as ﬁnger-
print or based on assigned numbers such as SSN. A
promising area of research is discovering human be-
havior that can be used for personal identiﬁcation
such as stepping behavior. The use of technology
is starting be tested as a personal identiﬁer as well.
The ﬁeld looking into computer keyboard usage is
keystroke dynamics.

Keystroke Dynamics use manner

and
rhythm which individuals types on keyboards as
personal identiﬁer. Most of this research was based
on static keyboards and used keyboard strokes,
duration and latency as features.

3.1 Data collection

We created a mobile application to collect
the data. The application presents three para-
graphs and we ask the user to type the text on
the screen as fast and as accurate as possible into
the input box. Over the term of this quarter we
have collected data in person using our mobile data
collector application. The data collection is done in
person using iPhone6s as our data collection device.
We decided that we should keep the type of collec-
tion device constant and we shouldn’t use a device
that certain users would be over adapted to. So we
decide to use iPhone6. We stored keystroke data
with additional accelerometer and gyro vectors. We
also gathered subject’s following personal informa-
tion: phone size, use of autocorrect, age, gender,

tion: phone size, use of autocorrect, age, gender,

Over the time of 2 weeks we collected 132

samples with the following breakdown:

3.2 Data Processing

After collecting a data point, it is sent to our
python server where we store it for analysis. The
data was stored in JSON format, and passed in to
a python program which extracts the features to a
feature matrix for each subject.

3.3 Generating features

We collected age, gender, number of ﬁngers
used, regular phone used, size of phone, autocor-
rect, and mother tongue as possible predictable val-
ues. Later we decided the concentrate only on age,
gender and number of ﬁngers used.

Thinking about diﬀerent possible features we
can extract from key logs and some online research
based on other studies we came up with 29 diﬀerent
features to used. These features include:

• Speed based features such as total completion

time, average time between keys

• Accuracy based features such as total keys
pressed, number of backspaces used, edit dis-
tance to original text

• Special keys based features such as the time to

ﬁnd shift key and insert punctuation

• Accelerometer information on x, y, z axises
such as change in accelerometer when hitting
“next” and also average accelerometer value
through typing

• Gyrometer information on x, y, z axises such as
change in accelerometer when hitting “next”
and also average accelerometer value through
typing

Where TP = number of true positives (eg.

We used balanced accuracy as our standard
to choose the best features. This is because since
our data was skewed (more young than old, more
two ﬁngers than one ﬁnger), simply computing the
total accuracy gave us misleading results.

4.2 Features overview and Selection

We currently have 29 diﬀerent features.
These features can be categorized under 5 main dif-
ferent groups: Time, content accuracy, key presses,
special keys, accelerometer and gyroscope. We se-
lected top 5 features for each of our classiﬁers and
used those for model selection. We tried to run
PCA but it didn’t really help to our app besides
better visuals for graphing. Selecting best features
we ran each of them one by one with all possible
models. Below you can ﬁnd top features for each
classiﬁer with the balanced accuracy they returned
when the models were run only with the selected
feature. We ran all features alone using 0.1 left out
CV with 7 diﬀerent classiﬁers. We selected the top
5 for each.

Number of thumbs turned out to be the eas-
iest value to predict correctly. It is also highly cor-
related with age (older people tend to use 1 ﬁnger
more often than younger people). This also ex-
plains why average time is up there as a top fea-
ture. The most useful feature for this prediction
turned out to be fastest time between keys. This is
the average of the top 10 fastest key press combi-
nations. It is likely that when typing with one ﬁn-
ger, it is diﬃcult to type two keys simultaneously
at a fast speed, while it is easy and more common
while typing with two ﬁngers. Also we found that
the gyroscope data was diﬀerent for one ﬁnger typ-
ists. Our suspicion is that holding the phone with
one hand leads to diﬀerent holding angles, and thus
these features were useful.

Finally, predicting age was our top priority
for this project. We expected that older people
would take a signiﬁcantly longer time to type in
the text. Our results conﬁrmed this, as the top four
features are related to typing speed. With just av-
erage time between keys, and shift time (time taken
to press shift), we were able to capture most of the
observable diﬀerences between the age classes, and
achieve acceptable high accuracy scores.

We decided to classify ages between two
groups: older and younger than 30.
In order to
pick this threshold we took into account both the
accuracies of each model with diﬀerent age thresh-
olds. Furthermore, we also tried to balance it by
trying to keep the groups (older and younger than
30) with similar number of training examples.

For selecting optimal models, we ran each
model in the following list with our top features
for each classiﬁer. Interestingly enough, our three
diﬀerent Y variables were each predicted best with
a diﬀerent model.

These are the ones we tested:

• KMeans with 2 clusters
• Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
• Linear Discriminant Analysis
• Decision Tree Classiﬁer, depth of 5
• K Nearest Neighbors Classiﬁer
• Support Vector Machine Classiﬁers (with sev-

eral kernels)

• Gaussian Naive Bayes
• Logistic Regression

In the next table you can see the scores we
got from each model. These scores were obtained
by running the models with the best parameters we
could ﬁnd, and using the top ﬁve features for each
Y. As you can see, each prediction was optimized
with a diﬀerent model:

cally, we ran K-means clustering and Aﬃnity Prop-

For gender Logistic Regression came out as
the most predictive model. Although 0.603 is not
an extremely high number, we were pleased to be
able to distinguish males and females by even a
small margin.
It turns out that the most useful
feature here was edit distance (The number of mod-
iﬁcations to the person’s input required for it to be
equal to the prompt text). It turns out that males
tend to make more mistakes while typing, or they
simply make less backspaces to correct input. An-
other useful feature was the x direction gyroscope
reading. According to our ﬁndings, females tend to
hold the phone at a slightly higher angle; it could
be related to the person’s height, or maybe the way
in which the male pose tends to diﬀer from the fe-

0.752, 0.603, 0.809 on balanced accuracy.

1 Background

Keystroke Dynamics based Authentication
(KDA) related work was also conducted for mo-
bile phones. Most of this research was based on
decreasing errors for user authentication and they
were conducted on handheld phones which didn’t
provide sensor information.

Introduction

Diﬀerent from the previous work on KDA
our project was focused on predicting actual in-
formation about the users based on the keystroke
dynamics and phone sensor information. With our
project TypeGuess we aim to predict individuals
typing style (number of ﬁngers), age and gender as
they type.

3 Dataset

Personal identiﬁers are a subset of of infor-
mation that alone or combined with certain infor-
mation can identify a unique individual. Most of
the current PIDs are either biometric such as ﬁnger-
print or based on assigned numbers such as SSN. A
promising area of research is discovering human be-
havior that can be used for personal identiﬁcation
such as stepping behavior. The use of technology
is starting be tested as a personal identiﬁer as well.
The ﬁeld looking into computer keyboard usage is
keystroke dynamics.

Keystroke Dynamics use manner

and
rhythm which individuals types on keyboards as
personal identiﬁer. Most of this research was based
on static keyboards and used keyboard strokes,
duration and latency as features.

3.1 Data collection

We created a mobile application to collect
the data. The application presents three para-
graphs and we ask the user to type the text on
the screen as fast and as accurate as possible into
the input box. Over the term of this quarter we
have collected data in person using our mobile data
collector application. The data collection is done in
person using iPhone6s as our data collection device.
We decided that we should keep the type of collec-
tion device constant and we shouldn’t use a device
that certain users would be over adapted to. So we
decide to use iPhone6. We stored keystroke data
with additional accelerometer and gyro vectors. We
also gathered subject’s following personal informa-
tion: phone size, use of autocorrect, age, gender,

1

mother tongue, and number of thumbs their use to
type.

Over the time of 2 weeks we collected 132

samples with the following breakdown:

Property
Male
Female
<30 years old
>30 years old
1 ﬁnger
2 ﬁngers

0.48
0.68
0.32

0.816

3.2 Data Processing

After collecting a data point, it is sent to our
python server where we store it for analysis. The
data was stored in JSON format, and passed in to
a python program which extracts the features to a
feature matrix for each subject.

3.3 Generating features

We collected age, gender, number of ﬁngers
used, regular phone used, size of phone, autocor-
rect, and mother tongue as possible predictable val-
ues. Later we decided the concentrate only on age,
gender and number of ﬁngers used.

Thinking about diﬀerent possible features we
can extract from key logs and some online research
based on other studies we came up with 29 diﬀerent
features to used. These features include:

• Speed based features such as total completion

time, average time between keys

• Accuracy based features such as total keys
pressed, number of backspaces used, edit dis-
tance to original text

• Special keys based features such as the time to

ﬁnd shift key and insert punctuation

• Accelerometer information on x, y, z axises
such as change in accelerometer when hitting
“next” and also average accelerometer value
through typing

• Gyrometer information on x, y, z axises such as
change in accelerometer when hitting “next”
and also average accelerometer value through
typing

Where TP = number of true positives (eg.

predicted old, actual old)
TN = number of true negatives
FP = number of false positives
FN = number of false negatives

We used balanced accuracy as our standard
to choose the best features. This is because since
our data was skewed (more young than old, more
two ﬁngers than one ﬁnger), simply computing the
total accuracy gave us misleading results.

4.2 Features overview and Selection

We currently have 29 diﬀerent features.
These features can be categorized under 5 main dif-
ferent groups: Time, content accuracy, key presses,
special keys, accelerometer and gyroscope. We se-
lected top 5 features for each of our classiﬁers and
used those for model selection. We tried to run
PCA but it didn’t really help to our app besides
better visuals for graphing. Selecting best features
we ran each of them one by one with all possible
models. Below you can ﬁnd top features for each
classiﬁer with the balanced accuracy they returned
when the models were run only with the selected
feature. We ran all features alone using 0.1 left out
CV with 7 diﬀerent classiﬁers. We selected the top
5 for each.

4.3 Number of ﬁngers

Best features (Balanced Accuracy):
• Fastest time between keys, 0.779
• Average time between keys, 0.695
• Total time, 0.649
• Gyroscope Y coordinates, 0.634
• Gyroscope Z coordinates, 0.623

Balanced Accuracy: 0.809

Number of thumbs turned out to be the eas-
iest value to predict correctly. It is also highly cor-
related with age (older people tend to use 1 ﬁnger
more often than younger people). This also ex-
plains why average time is up there as a top fea-
ture. The most useful feature for this prediction
turned out to be fastest time between keys. This is
the average of the top 10 fastest key press combi-
nations. It is likely that when typing with one ﬁn-
ger, it is diﬃcult to type two keys simultaneously
at a fast speed, while it is easy and more common
while typing with two ﬁngers. Also we found that
the gyroscope data was diﬀerent for one ﬁnger typ-
ists. Our suspicion is that holding the phone with
one hand leads to diﬀerent holding angles, and thus
these features were useful.

4.4 Age

Best features (Balanced Accuracy):

• Average time between keys, 0.709
• Fastest time between keys, 0.678
• Total time, 0.673

• Time to press ’shift’ key, 0.611
• Number of backspaces, 0.578

Statistics:
Top Model: SVC Linear Kernel
Balabced Accuracy: 0.752
Testing error: 0.248
Training error: 0.126

Finally, predicting age was our top priority
for this project. We expected that older people
would take a signiﬁcantly longer time to type in
the text. Our results conﬁrmed this, as the top four
features are related to typing speed. With just av-
erage time between keys, and shift time (time taken
to press shift), we were able to capture most of the
observable diﬀerences between the age classes, and
achieve acceptable high accuracy scores.

We decided to classify ages between two
groups: older and younger than 30.
In order to
pick this threshold we took into account both the
accuracies of each model with diﬀerent age thresh-
olds. Furthermore, we also tried to balance it by
trying to keep the groups (older and younger than
30) with similar number of training examples.

male’s.

4.6 Model selection

For selecting optimal models, we ran each
model in the following list with our top features
for each classiﬁer. Interestingly enough, our three
diﬀerent Y variables were each predicted best with
a diﬀerent model.

These are the ones we tested:

• KMeans with 2 clusters
• Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
• Linear Discriminant Analysis
• Decision Tree Classiﬁer, depth of 5
• K Nearest Neighbors Classiﬁer
• Support Vector Machine Classiﬁers (with sev-

eral kernels)

• Gaussian Naive Bayes
• Logistic Regression

In the next table you can see the scores we
got from each model. These scores were obtained
by running the models with the best parameters we
could ﬁnd, and using the top ﬁve features for each
Y. As you can see, each prediction was optimized
with a diﬀerent model:

4.7 Unsupervised learning

Although all our data was labelled, we
thought we might attempt to run some unsuper-
vised learning algorithms on our dataset. Speciﬁ-
cally, we ran K-means clustering and Aﬃnity Prop-

• Edit distance(User Input, Shown Text), 0.600
• Gyrometer X coordinates, 0.583
• Number of backspaces, 0.581
• Total keys pressed, 0.576
• Gyrometer Y coordinates, 0.572

Statistics:
Top Model: SVC Linear Kernel
Accuracy: 0.603
Testing error: 0.397
Training error: 0.303

For gender Logistic Regression came out as
the most predictive model. Although 0.603 is not
an extremely high number, we were pleased to be
able to distinguish males and females by even a
small margin.
It turns out that the most useful
feature here was edit distance (The number of mod-
iﬁcations to the person’s input required for it to be
equal to the prompt text). It turns out that males
tend to make more mistakes while typing, or they
simply make less backspaces to correct input. An-
other useful feature was the x direction gyroscope
reading. According to our ﬁndings, females tend to
hold the phone at a slightly higher angle; it could
be related to the person’s height, or maybe the way
in which the male pose tends to diﬀer from the fe-

agation. K-means clustering with 2 clusters re-
sulted in satisfactory results: around 0.69 accuracy
for predicting age and 0.72 accuracy for predicting
number of ﬁngers. Although we could get some use
from these results, they were inferior to most of the
supervised algorithms that we ran. Aﬃnity prop-
agation, like several other clustering algorithms, is
meant for ﬁnding many more than two clusters, so
it was not ﬁt for our two bucket classiﬁcation prob-
lem. The results we managed to get here were un-
satisfactory, so we stuck with our best supervised
models.

4.8 PCA

After selecting most of our features and just
before implementing model selection we wanted to
check the eﬀect of PCA so we also ran many models
with PCA as well. Though the diﬀerence in accu-
racy was negligible. For some models PCA had a
small positive eﬀect, while for others it had a small
negative eﬀect. As we talked in class PCA is much
suitable for visualization or optimization in large
datasets. We also attempted using AdaBoost, but
this didn’t really improve our performace either.

5 Conclusion and Future work

Overall, our work indicates that it is possible
to predict a person’s information based on mobile
typing dynamics. We believe that our current work
can serve as a stepping stone.

We believe that keystroke dynamics com-
bined with sensor information has potential to pre-
dict signiﬁcant amount of personal information. In
order to move this research forward there is a huge
need for more data. The data needs to be more
diverse and more detailed. Currently we have typ-
ing info of less than three minutes. This can be
signiﬁcantly expanded by logging keystrokes dur-
ing daily uses. Additionally it’s possible to extract
even more features using latent feature models. A
diﬀerent approach to this problem might be using
deep learning if high amounts of user data is ac-
quired.
