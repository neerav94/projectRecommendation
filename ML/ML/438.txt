Abstract

To better understand the meaning of positions in the NBA, I train several models to predict a player’s
position from his stats, such as average speed on the court and number of three point attempts per
game. The NBA and ESPN use diﬀerent position labels, so I compare the performance of my models in
predicting these labels separately. Ultimately, I hope that this analysis can determine how well position
labels describe NBA player roles and identify the deﬁning characteristics of each position.

1 Introduction

Basketball is a unique sport in that there are no position speciﬁc rules or statistics. All players are traditionally
measured by the number of rebounds, blocks, and steals they get on defense and the number of points they
score, passes they make, and assists they get on oﬀense. Therefore, position labels can be somewhat ambiguous:
the NBA classiﬁes players as either a Guard, Guard-Forward, Forward, Forward-Center, or Center, and ESPN
classiﬁes players as either a Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, or Center. This
has led some to do cluster analysis on NBA players to discover more and ”new” positions other than the
traditional ﬁve [1].

The goal of this analysis is to determine how well existing position labels actually describe a player’s game.
This is done by building models to predict position label from player stats. I consider two diﬀerent position
labeling schemes, namely those given by the NBA and ESPN, and compare model performance in predicting
these labels separately.
In addition, by analyzing these models, I can identify the features that are most
predictive of position.

2 Data

This analysis looks at 340 players from the 2013/2014 NBA season. I use 19 features for each player to predict
two separate position labels.

2.1 Response

I scraped players’ NBA and ESPN position labels from those organizations’ respective websites [2] [3]. Table
1 below shows the relationship between these two position labeling schemes for players from the 2013/2014
season. The middle row of this table, for example, says that among players classiﬁed by the NBA as Forwards,
ESPN classiﬁes about half of them as Small Forwards and the other half as Power Forwards.

2.2 Predictors

Prior to the 2013/2014 season, the NBA installed SportVU cameras into every team’s arena. These cameras
capture what is known as Player Tracking data, which consists of advanced player stats such as distance
traveled and secondary assists. These are the stats that I use as predictors.

Because of the novelty of these cameras, I am limited to one full season of this data. I further condensed
my dataset by including only players who played at least 30 games during the season and averaged at least
10 minutes per game in order to ensure that each player had suﬃcient data.

The Player Tracking data contains around 100 features for each player, but much of it is repetitive. For
example, points per game is included but so are total points and number of games played. Additionally, this
analysis attempts to focus on style of play as opposed to quality of play, meaning that I am interested in
statistics such as number of three point attempts rather than three point percentage. Table 2 below shows
the features that this analysis considers, all of which are continuous.

during a game, I standardized these statistics to be reported on a per 48 minute basis. Speciﬁcally, if statistic
sp is reported as a per game statistic (e.g. blocks per game) for player p and player p plays on average mp

2.3 Standardizing the Data

Because most of the stats are given on a per game basis and not all players play the same amount of time
during a game, I standardized these statistics to be reported on a per 48 minute basis. Speciﬁcally, if statistic
sp is reported as a per game statistic (e.g. blocks per game) for player p and player p plays on average mp
minutes per game, I transform the statistic as sp
mp

∗ 48.

2

To allow for more interpretable results, I then standardized each variable as sp−¯s

, where sp is the player’s

σs

stat, and ¯s and σs are the average and standard deviation of that stat respectively across all players.

3 Models

I explored three diﬀerent models that perform multi-class classiﬁcation: Multinomial Logistic Regression,
Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine.

3.1 Multinomial Logistic Regression
For a classiﬁcation problem with k classes, Multinomial Logistic Regression estimates k− 1 coeﬃcient vectors,
θ1, ..., θk−1 and deﬁnes θk to be the zero vector. These coeﬃcient vectors determine the probability that
a given sample x belongs to any of the k classes. Predictions are assigned to the class with the highest
probability. Formally, if y = 1, ..., k are the k classes:

P (y = j|x; θ) =

j = 1...k − 1

(cid:80)k

exp(θT
j x)
i=1 exp(θT

i x)

P (y = k|x; θ) = 1 − k−1(cid:88)

P (y = i|x; θ)

In this analysis, coeﬃcients are estimated using the multinom function in R’s nnet library. The utility of

these coeﬃcients in understanding how this model makes predictions is explained later in this paper.

i=1

3.2 Linear Discriminant Analysis
LDA models p(x|y) as a multivariate normal distribution, and a strong assumption is that all classes share
the same covariance matrix, Σ. Formally:

x|y = i ∼ N (µi, Σ)

This could be problematic in this dataset because some features may vary a lot more for certain positions
than others. Centers, for example, rarely drive the ball because they spend most of their time on oﬀense
under the basket, so the drives.DVS feature should have a relatively small variance for Centers. However,
there should be a lot more variance for this feature among Guards because some Guards drive the ball while
others are primarily perimeter shooters. In future analysis, I will look at Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, a
generalization of LDA where each class has a separate covariance matrix, in order to hopefully remedy this
problem. I use the lda function in R’s MASS library to implement LDA.

3.3 Support Vector Machine

To implement SVM, I use the svm function in R’s e1071 library. This is R’s implementation of LIBSVM.
For multi-class classiﬁcation with SVM, LIBSVM uses the ”one-against-one” approach in which k(k − 1)/2
classiﬁers are built, each of which trains on data from only two classes [4].
I experimented with several
diﬀerent kernels, including linear and radial kernels, but I only report the error from the linear kernel because
this performed best.

4 Results

I assessed the performance of these models in two ways. First, I trained on a random 70% split of the data
(226 players), tested on the remaining 30% (114 players), and reported the training and test error. Second,
I performed 10-fold cross validation and reported this estimate of test error. The error metric used is the
misclassiﬁcation rate. Tables 3a and 3b summarize the results.

3.2 Linear Discriminant Analysis
LDA models p(x|y) as a multivariate normal distribution, and a strong assumption is that all classes share
the same covariance matrix, Σ. Formally:

x|y = i ∼ N (µi, Σ)

This could be problematic in this dataset because some features may vary a lot more for certain positions

4.1 Error Analysis

A confusion matrix gives a better idea of the performance of these models because certain misclassiﬁcations
are better/worse than others. Basketball positions fall roughly on a spectrum with Guards on one end and
Centers on the other. Therefore, we absolutely do not want to see a Point Guard classiﬁed as a Center, but
it is understandable to have a Point Guard classiﬁed as a Shooting Guard. Table 4 shows a confusion matrix
of the ESPN position predictions of Multinomial Logistic Regression on a 30% test set. The ﬁrst column, for
example, says that among Point Guards, this model classiﬁed 24 as Point Guards and 2 as Shooting Guards.

5 Discussion

SVM outperformed the other models when training and testing on a 50/50 split (results not shown), but the
other models caught up quickly as demonstrated by the errors for the 70/30 split in Tables 3a and 3b. All of
the models ultimately produced remarkably similar levels of accuracy on both position labeling schemes, and
none of them were able to predict position with greater than roughly 65% accuracy. This result suggests that
there is a lot of overlap among positions.

This analysis can also be used to better understand the existing position labels. In Table 4, we see that
there are several Power Forwards classiﬁed as Centers, two of whom are Pau Gasol and Tiago Splitter. What
separates these players from other Power Forwards? By analyzing the Multinomial Logistic Regression model
coeﬃcients, we can answer this question. Both Gasol and Splitter are distinguished by their above average
rebounding ability, and as a result, they both have large positive values for rebounding.OREB CHANCE
and rebounding.DREB CHANCE. Conversely, the Power Forward coeﬃcients for these two features are very
negative in the model that uses Center as the referent group (the group for which the coeﬃcients are deﬁned
to be zero). Referring to the equations for Multinomial Logistic Regression detailed previously, this means
that positive rebounding values (above average), boost a player’s probability of being a Center relative to
being a Power Forward, and vice versa. This partly explains why both Gasol and Splitter were classiﬁed as
Centers.

Similar analysis of these coeﬃcients can be done for other positions as well. Point Guards have a much
higher positive coeﬃcient than all other positions for passing.PASS, meaning that if a player makes a lot of
passes, his probability of being a Point Guard relative to being any other position is boosted. Point Guards,
Shooting Guards, and Small Forwards all have a similar positive coeﬃcient for pullUpShoot.FG3A while this
coeﬃcient for Power Forwards is near zero. Thus, if a player takes a lot of pull-up threes, his probability of
being either a Point Guard, Shooting Guard, or Small Forward goes up relative to his probability of being a
Power Forward or a Center.

Abstract

To better understand the meaning of positions in the NBA, I train several models to predict a player’s
position from his stats, such as average speed on the court and number of three point attempts per
game. The NBA and ESPN use diﬀerent position labels, so I compare the performance of my models in
predicting these labels separately. Ultimately, I hope that this analysis can determine how well position
labels describe NBA player roles and identify the deﬁning characteristics of each position.

1 Introduction

Basketball is a unique sport in that there are no position speciﬁc rules or statistics. All players are traditionally
measured by the number of rebounds, blocks, and steals they get on defense and the number of points they
score, passes they make, and assists they get on oﬀense. Therefore, position labels can be somewhat ambiguous:
the NBA classiﬁes players as either a Guard, Guard-Forward, Forward, Forward-Center, or Center, and ESPN
classiﬁes players as either a Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, or Center. This
has led some to do cluster analysis on NBA players to discover more and ”new” positions other than the
traditional ﬁve [1].

The goal of this analysis is to determine how well existing position labels actually describe a player’s game.
This is done by building models to predict position label from player stats. I consider two diﬀerent position
labeling schemes, namely those given by the NBA and ESPN, and compare model performance in predicting
these labels separately.
In addition, by analyzing these models, I can identify the features that are most
predictive of position.

2 Data

This analysis looks at 340 players from the 2013/2014 NBA season. I use 19 features for each player to predict
two separate position labels.

2.1 Response

I scraped players’ NBA and ESPN position labels from those organizations’ respective websites [2] [3]. Table
1 below shows the relationship between these two position labeling schemes for players from the 2013/2014
season. The middle row of this table, for example, says that among players classiﬁed by the NBA as Forwards,
ESPN classiﬁes about half of them as Small Forwards and the other half as Power Forwards.

2.2 Predictors

Prior to the 2013/2014 season, the NBA installed SportVU cameras into every team’s arena. These cameras
capture what is known as Player Tracking data, which consists of advanced player stats such as distance
traveled and secondary assists. These are the stats that I use as predictors.

Because of the novelty of these cameras, I am limited to one full season of this data. I further condensed
my dataset by including only players who played at least 30 games during the season and averaged at least
10 minutes per game in order to ensure that each player had suﬃcient data.

The Player Tracking data contains around 100 features for each player, but much of it is repetitive. For
example, points per game is included but so are total points and number of games played. Additionally, this
analysis attempts to focus on style of play as opposed to quality of play, meaning that I am interested in
statistics such as number of three point attempts rather than three point percentage. Table 2 below shows
the features that this analysis considers, all of which are continuous.

2.3 Standardizing the Data

Because most of the stats are given on a per game basis and not all players play the same amount of time
during a game, I standardized these statistics to be reported on a per 48 minute basis. Speciﬁcally, if statistic
sp is reported as a per game statistic (e.g. blocks per game) for player p and player p plays on average mp
minutes per game, I transform the statistic as sp
mp

∗ 48.

2

To allow for more interpretable results, I then standardized each variable as sp−¯s

, where sp is the player’s

σs

stat, and ¯s and σs are the average and standard deviation of that stat respectively across all players.

3 Models

I explored three diﬀerent models that perform multi-class classiﬁcation: Multinomial Logistic Regression,
Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine.

3.1 Multinomial Logistic Regression
For a classiﬁcation problem with k classes, Multinomial Logistic Regression estimates k− 1 coeﬃcient vectors,
θ1, ..., θk−1 and deﬁnes θk to be the zero vector. These coeﬃcient vectors determine the probability that
a given sample x belongs to any of the k classes. Predictions are assigned to the class with the highest
probability. Formally, if y = 1, ..., k are the k classes:

P (y = j|x; θ) =

j = 1...k − 1

(cid:80)k

exp(θT
j x)
i=1 exp(θT

i x)

P (y = k|x; θ) = 1 − k−1(cid:88)

P (y = i|x; θ)

In this analysis, coeﬃcients are estimated using the multinom function in R’s nnet library. The utility of

these coeﬃcients in understanding how this model makes predictions is explained later in this paper.

i=1

3.2 Linear Discriminant Analysis
LDA models p(x|y) as a multivariate normal distribution, and a strong assumption is that all classes share
the same covariance matrix, Σ. Formally:

x|y = i ∼ N (µi, Σ)

This could be problematic in this dataset because some features may vary a lot more for certain positions
than others. Centers, for example, rarely drive the ball because they spend most of their time on oﬀense
under the basket, so the drives.DVS feature should have a relatively small variance for Centers. However,
there should be a lot more variance for this feature among Guards because some Guards drive the ball while
others are primarily perimeter shooters. In future analysis, I will look at Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, a
generalization of LDA where each class has a separate covariance matrix, in order to hopefully remedy this
problem. I use the lda function in R’s MASS library to implement LDA.

3.3 Support Vector Machine

To implement SVM, I use the svm function in R’s e1071 library. This is R’s implementation of LIBSVM.
For multi-class classiﬁcation with SVM, LIBSVM uses the ”one-against-one” approach in which k(k − 1)/2
classiﬁers are built, each of which trains on data from only two classes [4].
I experimented with several
diﬀerent kernels, including linear and radial kernels, but I only report the error from the linear kernel because
this performed best.

4 Results

I assessed the performance of these models in two ways. First, I trained on a random 70% split of the data
(226 players), tested on the remaining 30% (114 players), and reported the training and test error. Second,
I performed 10-fold cross validation and reported this estimate of test error. The error metric used is the
misclassiﬁcation rate. Tables 3a and 3b summarize the results.

4.1 Error Analysis

A confusion matrix gives a better idea of the performance of these models because certain misclassiﬁcations
are better/worse than others. Basketball positions fall roughly on a spectrum with Guards on one end and
Centers on the other. Therefore, we absolutely do not want to see a Point Guard classiﬁed as a Center, but
it is understandable to have a Point Guard classiﬁed as a Shooting Guard. Table 4 shows a confusion matrix
of the ESPN position predictions of Multinomial Logistic Regression on a 30% test set. The ﬁrst column, for
example, says that among Point Guards, this model classiﬁed 24 as Point Guards and 2 as Shooting Guards.

5 Discussion

SVM outperformed the other models when training and testing on a 50/50 split (results not shown), but the
other models caught up quickly as demonstrated by the errors for the 70/30 split in Tables 3a and 3b. All of
the models ultimately produced remarkably similar levels of accuracy on both position labeling schemes, and
none of them were able to predict position with greater than roughly 65% accuracy. This result suggests that
there is a lot of overlap among positions.

This analysis can also be used to better understand the existing position labels. In Table 4, we see that
there are several Power Forwards classiﬁed as Centers, two of whom are Pau Gasol and Tiago Splitter. What
separates these players from other Power Forwards? By analyzing the Multinomial Logistic Regression model
coeﬃcients, we can answer this question. Both Gasol and Splitter are distinguished by their above average
rebounding ability, and as a result, they both have large positive values for rebounding.OREB CHANCE
and rebounding.DREB CHANCE. Conversely, the Power Forward coeﬃcients for these two features are very
negative in the model that uses Center as the referent group (the group for which the coeﬃcients are deﬁned
to be zero). Referring to the equations for Multinomial Logistic Regression detailed previously, this means
that positive rebounding values (above average), boost a player’s probability of being a Center relative to
being a Power Forward, and vice versa. This partly explains why both Gasol and Splitter were classiﬁed as
Centers.

Similar analysis of these coeﬃcients can be done for other positions as well. Point Guards have a much
higher positive coeﬃcient than all other positions for passing.PASS, meaning that if a player makes a lot of
passes, his probability of being a Point Guard relative to being any other position is boosted. Point Guards,
Shooting Guards, and Small Forwards all have a similar positive coeﬃcient for pullUpShoot.FG3A while this
coeﬃcient for Power Forwards is near zero. Thus, if a player takes a lot of pull-up threes, his probability of
being either a Point Guard, Shooting Guard, or Small Forward goes up relative to his probability of being a
Power Forward or a Center.

6 Conclusions

I expected that I would not be able to predict position with very high accuracy. In theory, basketball positions
are well-deﬁned — Point Guards possess and pass the ball while Shooting Guards take shots — but in reality,
the lines between positions are blurred. The fact that I was able to achieve similar accuracy with two diﬀerent
position labels (albeit with substantial overlap) reinforces this notion. These results suggest that doing a
cluster analysis to ”redeﬁne” positions in basketball is justiﬁed, such as that done by Lutz [1].

However, this analysis does provide a lot of insight into what features are characteristic of existing positions.
By interpreting the coeﬃcients of the Multinomial Logistic Regression model for example, we were able to see
which features distinguished diﬀerent positions. This paper details only a small portion of the information
about positions that can be inferred from this analysis.

7 Future

Because the Player Tracking data exists for only one full season, I was limited by a small sample size. As
more data becomes available, I will be able to extend my analysis further. I also need to address problems
of collinearity in the dataset. Some features, such as number of possessions and time of possession, show
some correlation, and this causes these features to have unstable coeﬃcient estimates in Multinomial Logistic
Regression. Similarly, I would like to use a more elaborate feature selection strategy. Finally, I would like to
try Quadratic Discriminant Analysis because this model does not have the potentially problematic assumption
of LDA described previously.
