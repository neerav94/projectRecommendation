Introduction

There has been increased scrutiny in understanding the anthropogenic sources for methane emissions due to methane’s
potency as a greenhouse gas [2]. There are two approaches for studying of methane emissions, emissions inventories
(or ‘bottom up’ studies), and remote measurements of methane ﬂuxes (or ‘top down’ studies). Emissions inventories
calculate the leakage rates for fugitive methane over a given area as:

M(cid:88)

N(cid:88)

E =

Ai,j × EFi

(1)

j

i

where E is the emissions rate, Ai,j is the activity (or the number of pieces of equipment of type i) at well pad j,
EFi is the emissions factor for equipment type i, N is the set of possible equipment types, and M is the set of wells
in the location of interest. The inner sum provides the emissions rate for a speciﬁc well pad.

One of the signiﬁcant problems with the ‘bottom up’ emissions inventory approach is that of scale. Even when very
detailed measurements of the equipment and stages of operations are conducted, doing so comes at the price at
looking at a small and not necessarily representative sample of the wells and operators. This is the most signiﬁcant
critique of Allen et al. which found lower leakage numbers when compared to other emissions inventories [3]. In order
to better rectify the discrepancies between the ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’ studies, two simultaneous development
need to occur. There needs to be more proper accounting for the number of devices and pieces of equipment present
on a particular site and there needs to be better sampling and estimation of emissions factors at the device level.
The intention of this project, which is to apply machine learning techniques on high resolution spatial imagery to
identify well pads, is meant to serve as an initial step in this process.

While there is uncertainty in estimating both the activity counts and the emissions factors, there are also signiﬁcant
disagreements in simply estimating the number of well pads in a given location. For example the SI to Brandt et
al. report a 5x diﬀerence in the number of reported well completions in the United States between two diﬀerent
data sources (for 2010 the EPA reported 4871 wells, while IHS reported 18542) [2]. The purpose of this project is to
identify well pads using high resolution spatial imagery, which is a ﬁrst step towards estimating activity counts over
an entire production ﬁeld.

Machine learning classiﬁers are widely utilized for remote-sensing based classiﬁcations, and their application has been
of particular interest in the literature of classiﬁcation of high resolution spatial imagery. Common classiﬁers utilized
in the literature include Na¨ıve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Network, Random Forests, and SVM. Mountrakis
et al., in a review of the use of SVM for remote sensing applications, describe the ability for this classiﬁer to better
balance the bias-variance tradeoﬀ as well as it ability to use small training sets. They also demonstrate that SVMs
are disproportionally used in applications with high resolution imagery [5].

of particular interest as oil production has increased from ≈2000 bbl/day in 2005 to ≈ 1, 000, 000 bbl/day in 2014.
Speciﬁcally, the study area utilized was a ≈1150 km2 area of 1m2 pixel aerial photographs acquired in August 2012

from the National Aerial Imagery Program at the USDA. A map of the study area within the context of the Bakken
can be found in Figure 1.

.

For most remote sensing applications, analysis and classiﬁcation is performed at the pixel level. However, this has
been found to be not particularly eﬀective for high resolution imagery due to the the heterogeneity of adjacent pixels
[1]. The widely accepted technique for extracting data out of high resolution imagery has been to aggregate pixels
into image objects (or segments) [6]. In order to isolate these image objects, the eCognition software platform was
utilized using the multi-resolution segmentation function with the following parameters which were utilized to best
identify well pads: scale (which roughly corresponds to size) = 300, shape (or the inﬂuence of color on segment) =0.6,
and compactness (which corresponds to the ability of segments to have varying size) = 0.9. The result of this process
divided the image into 9485 segments, which serve as the input rows for the classiﬁer. This set was later trimmed
down to 7339 segments to avoid edge eﬀects around the perimeter of the region of interest. A visual example of the
result of segmentation can be found in Figure 1. Each of the segments has 175 features (or columns) derived from
three overarching categories: spectral reﬂectance (RGB and near IR) and brightness, segment geometry (shape and
size), and texture (which is based on the grey-level co-occurance matrix from Haralick et al.) [4].

A matrix representation with the segments as the rows and the features as the columns is used as the input data
for the classiﬁer. The output is a binary indicator for whether the test segment is or is not a well pad. The well
pads were veriﬁed with GIS layers of known oil and gas facilities in North Dakota [7], and further reﬁned by hand.

Well pads are geographically scarce throughout the Bakken oil ﬁeld, and since size and shape are important segmen-

the 7339 segments used (post-processing), only 195 are well pads (2.66%). Consequently, a classiﬁcation could have
a 95% success rate while successfully identifying every well pad in the area, and still have falsely identiﬁed almost as
many wells as actually exist. In the context of using this classiﬁcation to estimate fugitive emissions, this degree of
error is well above an acceptable limit. Figure 3 demonstrates the scarcity of well pads in the data set, highlighting
the importance of highly accurate classiﬁcation.

as the testing set. Each algorithm is applied ten times to (the same set of) random permutations of the data, and
the ROC curves are shown in Figure 4.

The data set required is small enough that the time required for classiﬁcation, even for the entire Bakken oil ﬁeld, is
not prohibitively expensive. However, the computation time required to generate the features is; the data set used in
the limited area surveyed in this work took roughly 40 hours to generate. In order to determine the order in which to
include features, a principle component analysis (PCA) is performed ﬁrst. Examining the principle components (the
ﬁrst 10 of which are shown in Figure 5(a)) it is clear that each component is heavily dominated be a small subset of
features. An arbitrary (and conservative) threshold of 0.1 is set, and (in order) the features with coeﬃcients whose
absolute value exceeds the threshold are selected. This roughly ordered set of features is then used to explore the
eﬀect of reducing the feature space, by classifying the same random permutations of the data set used above with
the best performing algorithm, the Random Forest, with an increasing number of features. The resulting true and
false-positive rates are shown in Figure 5(b).

4 Discussion and Conclusions

The results of this work demonstrate the viability of utilizing machine learning classiﬁcation for well pad identiﬁcation
in the Bakken. As demonstrated in Figure 4, the overall accuracy of well pad identiﬁcation is highly dependent on the
acceptable rate of false positives. Though both the Neural Network and the Random Forest performed well overall,
the Random Forest beneﬁts the most with a give allowance of false positive error. The ROC curve shows a change
in the relative increased true positive rate as a function of false positive rate at an approximate 10% false-positive
rate, indicating that this point results in the best model performance for the intended application.

One of the signiﬁcant problems with the ‘bottom up’ emissions inventory approach is that of scale. Even when very

The intention of this project, which is to apply machine learning techniques on high resolution spatial imagery to

While there is uncertainty in estimating both the activity counts and the emissions factors, there are also signiﬁcant

of particular interest in the literature of classiﬁcation of high resolution spatial imagery. Common classiﬁers utilized
in the literature include Na¨ıve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Network, Random Forests, and SVM. Mountrakis
et al., in a review of the use of SVM for remote sensing applications, describe the ability for this classiﬁer to better
balance the bias-variance tradeoﬀ as well as it ability to use small training sets. They also demonstrate that SVMs
are disproportionally used in applications with high resolution imagery [5].

2 Methods and data

2.1 Data and preprocessing

The region of study for this project is the fast developing Bakken oil ﬁeld in Western North Dakota. This area is
of particular interest as oil production has increased from ≈2000 bbl/day in 2005 to ≈ 1, 000, 000 bbl/day in 2014.
Speciﬁcally, the study area utilized was a ≈1150 km2 area of 1m2 pixel aerial photographs acquired in August 2012

from the National Aerial Imagery Program at the USDA. A map of the study area within the context of the Bakken
can be found in Figure 1.

.

For most remote sensing applications, analysis and classiﬁcation is performed at the pixel level. However, this has
been found to be not particularly eﬀective for high resolution imagery due to the the heterogeneity of adjacent pixels
[1]. The widely accepted technique for extracting data out of high resolution imagery has been to aggregate pixels
into image objects (or segments) [6]. In order to isolate these image objects, the eCognition software platform was
utilized using the multi-resolution segmentation function with the following parameters which were utilized to best
identify well pads: scale (which roughly corresponds to size) = 300, shape (or the inﬂuence of color on segment) =0.6,
and compactness (which corresponds to the ability of segments to have varying size) = 0.9. The result of this process
divided the image into 9485 segments, which serve as the input rows for the classiﬁer. This set was later trimmed
down to 7339 segments to avoid edge eﬀects around the perimeter of the region of interest. A visual example of the
result of segmentation can be found in Figure 1. Each of the segments has 175 features (or columns) derived from
three overarching categories: spectral reﬂectance (RGB and near IR) and brightness, segment geometry (shape and
size), and texture (which is based on the grey-level co-occurance matrix from Haralick et al.) [4].

A matrix representation with the segments as the rows and the features as the columns is used as the input data
for the classiﬁer. The output is a binary indicator for whether the test segment is or is not a well pad. The well
pads were veriﬁed with GIS layers of known oil and gas facilities in North Dakota [7], and further reﬁned by hand.
A schematic of the model function can be found in Figure 2.

3 Results

Well pads are geographically scarce throughout the Bakken oil ﬁeld, and since size and shape are important segmen-
tation characteristics utilized in our application of eCognition, are also scarce amongst the generated segments. Of
the 7339 segments used (post-processing), only 195 are well pads (2.66%). Consequently, a classiﬁcation could have
a 95% success rate while successfully identifying every well pad in the area, and still have falsely identiﬁed almost as
many wells as actually exist. In the context of using this classiﬁcation to estimate fugitive emissions, this degree of
error is well above an acceptable limit. Figure 3 demonstrates the scarcity of well pads in the data set, highlighting
the importance of highly accurate classiﬁcation.

To better analyze classiﬁcations results (such as shown in Figure 3) we deﬁne both a true-positive and false-positive

The ﬁrst, true-positive rate (tpr), is the commonly used expression:

where yi is the true classiﬁcation, y(cid:48)
i is the hypothesized classiﬁcation, and m is the size of the testing set. The
second measure, false-positive rate (f pr) is deﬁned in this context slightly more conservative than is often seen, as:

A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is examined in order to explore the trade-oﬀ between tpr and f pr
in diﬀerent algorithms. To generate the curve, 75% of the available data is used as the training set, and 25% is used
as the testing set. Each algorithm is applied ten times to (the same set of) random permutations of the data, and
the ROC curves are shown in Figure 4.

The data set required is small enough that the time required for classiﬁcation, even for the entire Bakken oil ﬁeld, is
not prohibitively expensive. However, the computation time required to generate the features is; the data set used in
the limited area surveyed in this work took roughly 40 hours to generate. In order to determine the order in which to
include features, a principle component analysis (PCA) is performed ﬁrst. Examining the principle components (the
ﬁrst 10 of which are shown in Figure 5(a)) it is clear that each component is heavily dominated be a small subset of
features. An arbitrary (and conservative) threshold of 0.1 is set, and (in order) the features with coeﬃcients whose
absolute value exceeds the threshold are selected. This roughly ordered set of features is then used to explore the
eﬀect of reducing the feature space, by classifying the same random permutations of the data set used above with
the best performing algorithm, the Random Forest, with an increasing number of features. The resulting true and
false-positive rates are shown in Figure 5(b).

4 Discussion and Conclusions

The results of this work demonstrate the viability of utilizing machine learning classiﬁcation for well pad identiﬁcation
in the Bakken. As demonstrated in Figure 4, the overall accuracy of well pad identiﬁcation is highly dependent on the
acceptable rate of false positives. Though both the Neural Network and the Random Forest performed well overall,
the Random Forest beneﬁts the most with a give allowance of false positive error. The ROC curve shows a change
in the relative increased true positive rate as a function of false positive rate at an approximate 10% false-positive
rate, indicating that this point results in the best model performance for the intended application.

and false-positive rates.

Additionally, the result of the PCA allows for a dramatic reduction of the feature set, and consequently a signiﬁcant
reduction in computation eﬀort. Figure 5(b) demonstrates that after the inclusion of ≈ 65 featuers, the accuracy of
the classiﬁers do not improve considerably. We estimate that this could lead to a reduction in computation time of
50-65%.
In the process of this analysis, we added ≈ 725 km2 of area to an initial area of ≈ 425 km2. This additional data
was meant to provide an analysis on the eﬀect of classiﬁcation accuracy as the training set became larger, however
only a modest increase in classiﬁcation accuracy was observed. The lack of improvement likely resulted from using
the same segmentation parameters between data sets, which introduced some segmentation errors upon examining
the segments. However, the computation time required for segmentation was prohibitive to experimenting widely on
the eﬀect of segmentation parameter selection. With the analysis of feature space reduction performed in this work,
further analysis in this area can be performed. Additionally, the strict accuracy constraints for the calculation (low
acceptable false positive rate) likely contributed to the modest gains in accuracy.

Future work will utilize the classiﬁcation results of this work to isolate imagery in the immediate vicinity of the well
pads in order to perform a second segmentation step in order to identify surface equipment such as tanks, pumpjacks,
and compressors. This might test the limit of the spatial resolution of these images and as such higher resolution
imagery sources will also be explored.
